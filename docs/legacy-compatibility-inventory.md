# Legacy compatibility inventory (#148)

This inventory lists code that exists only to read, validate, display, repair
or migrate data shapes older than the current writers produce. It is a removal
plan, not a removal: every path below is reviewed, tested and gated, so each is
retired deliberately in its own change.

Surveyed at `72f94c3` on `implement/148-ui-rework`, 2026-09-28, and revised at
`76a7b23` after #180 (record-owned PC/NPC kinds, Setup envelope version 2)
merged. Each file, function and test ID cited here exists at `76a7b23`.

## Relation to the legacy retirement record

[Legacy retirement](legacy-retirement.md) is the finished record of #91: the
pre-cutover board, tables and migration readers it removed, the backups it
retained and the evidence behind it. That record is closed, so this forward
plan is a separate document. It covers what the canonical application has
since accumulated for its own older shapes. The #91 rejection endpoints that
remain are listed once here (B5) so every removable path is in one place.

## Production facts this plan relies on

A read-only production check on 2026-09-28 found one campaign and one militia
holding:

- one open week-8 Weekly Draft at revision 0 with no Action Slot choices, event
  occurrences, Persistent decisions, Table Adjustments or carried events;
- no Resolution Records (no confirmed week);
- six characters, all stored with `kind: 'pc'`, each with a matching roster
  entry.

The user confirmed there will be no data changes before release. Because the
draft is at revision 0, production also holds no accepted
`canonicalDraftOperation` rows and no `canonicalDraftTarget` rows.

"Safe now" below means safe given these facts. Before removing anything:

1. Re-run the read-only production check. The first Confirmation after release
   creates a Resolution Record, and every later edit creates stored draft and
   operation rows.
2. Check the dev deployment and any preview you intend to keep. A Convex schema
   push validates every stored document, not just production's. Dev held older
   data before #91 and may hold older rolls, kinds or records. The e2e seeding
   mutations in `convex/canonicalPersistenceFixtures.ts` and
   `convex/e2eFixtures.ts` also write some old shapes (noted per entry).

## Rules that apply to every removal

- **Zod schemas are the Convex schema.** `convex/lib/canonicalStorageValidators.ts`
  derives the `canonicalWeeklyDraft`, `canonicalDraftOperation` and
  `canonicalResolutionRecord` validators from `weeklyDraftDataSchema`,
  `weeklyDraftEditSchema` and `canonicalResolutionRecordSchema`.
  `canonicalMilitiaState.snapshot` comes from `militiaSnapshotSchema`
  (`convex/schema.ts`). Narrowing a union in `src/lib/weekly-draft-facts.ts` or
  `src/lib/weekly-draft-contract.ts` therefore narrows stored tables. If any
  stored document could still hold the old shape, use widen-migrate-narrow.
  Otherwise use this order: stop every writer of the shape, re-check stored
  data, then narrow the schema and delete the readers in one deploy.
- **Old browser tabs.** After narrowing, the Convex argument validators reject
  an old bundle that still sends the old shape. The current UI already sends
  none of the shapes in group A.
- **Two generic editors still write almost any schema field.** Several shapes
  described in code as "from an older editor" can still be written today
  through two generic editors built on `StructuredChoiceField`
  (`src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/structured-choice-field.tsx`):
  - **W1: the Event block's "Edit ... details" disclosure.** This is
    `EventOccurrenceEditors` in `event-occurrence-editors.tsx`, rendered for
    every Event block that is not still preparing. It edits the whole
    `eventOccurrenceSchema` except `origin`, `tableRoll` and `eventType`.
    Narrowed 2026-09-29 (#198): an allowlist of current fields
    (`event-occurrence-details.ts`), with no B1 field.
  - **W2: Activity's "Recorded candidate details" disclosure.** This is
    `CANDIDATE_FIELDS` in `activity-details.tsx`. It edits whole candidate
    trees, including each occurrence's `origin`. A fixes batch running in
    parallel with this inventory retires it. That had not landed at
    `76a7b23`: check that `CANDIDATE_FIELDS` is gone before relying on it.

  Entries that depend on retiring or narrowing W1 or W2 are in group B.

- **Rules coverage.** `pnpm -s rules:check` must stay at 0 errors.
  - Only IDs listed in a case's `tests` array in
    `tests/rules/coverage-catalog.ts` are pinned. Deleting or renaming one of
    those tests gives `missing test`, so edit the catalog's `tests`,
    `plannedTests` and, where it describes older data, `expected` in the same
    change.
  - Other `[rules.X]` tags in test titles are labels only.
  - Case IDs are fingerprinted in `tests/rules/case-inventory.json`. Removing a
    case needs a reviewed inventory update; only B5 might need one.
- **Keep corpus notes.** `docs/ai/ironfang-militia/militia-rules.md` records the
  departures made under Ruleset Versions 6, 7, 8 and 9. Those sections are
  fingerprinted, and the notes stay true.
- **Never reuse a Ruleset Version number.** `CANONICAL_WEEKLY_RULESET_VERSION`
  is 9 since #198 (assumed propaganda approval) and keeps its number even after
  the named constants for 6 and 7 go. The corpus notes, and
  any records in dev, refer to the older numbers.
- **Ruleset Version bumps.** Several removals delete a resolution branch for
  input that can no longer be expressed (A4, B1, B2). No reachable week changes
  its result, so by the `CONTEXT.md` definition no new Ruleset Version is
  needed. Each such change should still say so, and its reviewer should confirm
  it.
- **Keep forward-compatibility tolerance.** Once released weeks are confirmed,
  format-2 records at Ruleset Versions 8 and 9 will accumulate and never
  change. Later Ruleset Versions will need version-aware readers again, like
  `isBlankHitDiceLevel`. `describeRecordedChange`, the `sectionChips` catch and
  generic fact text therefore stay (see C7).

Sizes are rough, from reading the code, not from a trial removal. Test figures
count whole tests or fixtures that would go or be rewritten.

The biggest wins are A2 (dice arrays: a schema union, branches in about ten
readers, and the largest block of compatibility tests plus one e2e scenario),
A5 (the loose-format record readers) and B1 (the nested Event fallbacks, once
W1 is gone).

---

## A. Safe to remove now

### A1. Dead compatibility leftovers

- **Old shape:** none stored. These are helpers left behind by removed writers.
  - `mapLegacyOfficers` mapped the pre-canonical single-holder officer fields.
  - `getMaxActionsForRank` and `getMaxActionsForMilitia` served "Legacy
    compatibility until its truncating writer is retired (#66)", and that
    writer is gone.
  - The campaign-context preparation document (#64) fed the migration preflight
    that #91 deleted, together with its storage and editors.
- **Where:**
  - `src/lib/canonical-roster.ts`: `mapLegacyOfficers`. Only
    `src/lib/canonical-roster.test.ts` calls it.
  - `src/lib/militia-progression-rules.ts`: `getMaxActionsForRank` and
    `getMaxActionsForMilitia`. Nothing calls them.
  - `src/lib/canonical-campaign-context.ts`: `campaignContextDataSchema`,
    `campaignContextSchema`, `emptyCampaignContext`, `campaignContextWarnings`,
    `contextEventSchema`, `contextOrderSchema` (its `receiptStatus: 'unknown'`
    is "unknown legacy delivery") and `contextCacheSchema`.
    - Keep `contextSettlementSchema` and `contextBonusSchema`, which
      `src/lib/canonical-weekly-source.ts` uses.
    - Replace the `CampaignContext` type used in `src/lib/rules-foundations.ts`
      and `src/lib/rules-settlements.ts` with the inferred settlement, bonus and
      queued-effect types.
  - Optional: in `convex/lib/canonicalDraftTargets.ts`, the opaque-target branch
    of `ancestors` ("A legacy opaque target has no parent paths"). Production
    edits send JSON paths, and only `convex/canonicalDraftStorage.integration.test.ts`
    and `convex/persistentEventProjection.integration.test.ts` send flat
    targets such as `'slot:left'`.
- **Tests and tags:**
  - `src/lib/canonical-roster.test.ts`: the `mapLegacyOfficers` assertion.
  - `src/lib/canonical-campaign-context.test.ts`, 73 lines. Its
    `[context.absence]` is pinned by cases `F09.context-money` and
    `U01.context-first-use`, and `[context.delivery]` by `A21.context-orders`.
    Retarget those catalog entries to the `setup.*` and `ledger.*` tests
    already listed beside them.
    Otherwise `rules:check` reports them missing.
- **Order:** none.
- **Risk:** none for data. This is catalog work only.
- **Size:** about 230 source lines and 80 test lines.

### A2. Legacy dice arrays beside dice totals (#154, #155)

- **Old shape:** a `RawRoll` with individual `dice: number[]`. #154 taught
  readers the `{ diceTotal, diceCount }` form. #155 made every editor write
  totals (`totalRoll` in `roll-facts.ts`), so no page writes an array now.
- **Where:**
  - Schema: the first member of the `rawRollSchema` union in
    `src/lib/weekly-draft-facts.ts`. It reaches every stored roll: upkeep,
    activity, event, persistent, draft edits and records.
  - Normalizer: `normalizeRawRoll` and `rollRangeWarning` in
    `src/lib/raw-roll.ts`, which include the `'legacy-die'` range warning.
  - View facts (`src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/`):
    - `roll-facts.ts`: `LegacyRawRoll`, `isLegacyRoll`, `recordedDiceCount`,
      the array branches of `recordedRollExplanation` and `rangeAdvisory`, and
      `legacyDiceSlots`.
    - `legacyDiceSlots` feeds `RollFact.dice` (`types.ts`) through
      `phase-view.ts`, and no view reads that field.
  - Readers and editors:
    - `structured-choice-field.tsx`: the legacy member found by `rollUnion`,
      `isRawRollValue` and the "Recorded dice" read-only branch of `RollFields`.
    - `roll-total-field.tsx`: its comment about partial legacy dice.
    - `upkeep-warnings.ts`: the per-die wording of `rangeMessage`.
    - `persistent-check-facts.ts`: `rollText`.
    - `src/components/week-review/review-text.ts`: the `rollText` array
      branch.
- **Writers of the old shape still in the tree, to convert first:**
  - The test helper `roll(sides, ...dice)` in `tests/rules/upkeep-fixture.ts`.
    About 540 `roll(` calls in about 75 test files build rolls with it.
    Emitting `{ diceTotal: sum, diceCount: dice.length }` keeps them valid.
  - Dice-array literals in about 30 test and fixture files, including
    `src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/workspace-test-fixture.ts`,
    `tests/persistence/contracts.ts` and
    `tests/persistence/confirmation-contracts.ts`.
  - The deployed e2e seeding mutation in
    `convex/canonicalPersistenceFixtures.ts` (three literals).
  - `e2e/canonical-confirmation.spec.ts`.
- **Tests and tags:**
  - Delete the array-only cases in these files:
    - `src/lib/raw-roll.test.ts`
    - `src/lib/rules-roll-compatibility.test.ts` (the legacy outlier and
      mixed-form cases)
    - `src/lib/weekly-draft-roll-schema.test.ts`
    - in `src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/`:
      `upkeep-roll-compatibility.test.tsx` (`WEEK-15.upkeep-partial`,
      `upkeep-legacy-equivalence`), `activity-roll-compatibility.test.tsx`
      (`ACT-13.legacy-check`, `ACT-12.modifier-only-legacy`, `ACT-12.partial`),
      `nested-roll-compatibility.test.tsx` (`EVT-07.legacy-nested`,
      `EVT-11.invalid-explicit-clear`) and `roll-total-field.test.tsx`
      (`WEEK-15.total-incomplete`)
    - `src/components/historical-week/record-roll-compatibility.test.tsx`
      (`HIST-05.old-source`)
  - The total-form cases in those files test current behavior and stay.
  - Convex tests: "mixed roll forms…" in
    `convex/canonicalDraftPersistence.integration.test.ts`, "storage retains
    mixed…" in `convex/canonicalDraftStorage.integration.test.ts` and "mixed
    confirmed history…" in `convex/canonicalHistory.integration.test.ts`.
  - Browser: `exerciseRollCompatibility` in `e2e/support/roll-compatibility.ts`,
    called from `e2e/canonical-workspace.spec.ts`. It re-enters "legacy dice"
    after reading totals. A comment there still says no page writes totals,
    which has been untrue since #155. `connectAs` in the same file is shared with
    `e2e/support/team-conditions.ts` and must stay.
  - None of the array-only test IDs is catalog-pinned. Pinned tests that merely
    build arrays through `roll()` stay valid once the helper emits totals,
    including `rules.U02.dice-boundaries`. Re-run `rules:check`: per-die
    `'legacy-die'` warnings become whole-range `'total'` warnings, which could
    move a range assertion.
- **Order:** convert the helper and fixtures, then check dev and previews for
  stored arrays. Then narrow `rawRollSchema` and delete the readers in one
  deploy.
- **Risk and preconditions:** production has no rolls, so this is safe now. Dev
  and e2e preview data seeded by `canonicalPersistenceFixtures` may hold
  arrays. Clear it, or migrate it to totals, before the schema push.
- **Size:** about 130 source lines across about 12 files. About 1,300 test lines
  go or are rewritten, including the 348-line e2e helper and its unit test. The
  literal fixtures churn as well.

### A3. Actor-bearing treasury transfers (#158)

- **Old shape:** a transfer with a `characterId`, from before Ruleset Version 6
  made transfers characterless. It also covers the officer named in older
  treasury plan entries, and recorded `upkeep-transfer-officer` exceptions,
  which no code creates or requires any more.
- **Where:**
  - `src/lib/weekly-draft-contract.ts`: `characterId: id.optional()` on
    `treasuryTransfers` in `upkeepSchema`. The `upkeep_transfer` edit reuses it.
  - `src/lib/weekly-draft-consistency.ts`: `hasNewTransferCharacterOutsideCampaign`
    and its call in `acceptDraftOperation`.
  - In `src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/`: `legacyCharacterName` in
    `upkeep-sections.ts`, `types.ts` and `staged-transfer.tsx`.
  - `src/components/historical-week/record-review.ts`: `findTransferActor` and
    the actor suffix in `transferItems`.
  - Optional: the always-null `characterId` on the `treasury` entry of
    `UpkeepChange` and in `treasury()`, both in `src/lib/rules-upkeep.ts`.
    Dropping it changes the plan shape new records store, which is harmless
    before the first record. Expected plans in tests change with it.
- **Writers:** none. `upkeep-transfer-edits.ts` sends
  `{ transferId, direction, copper }`.
- **Tests and tags:**
  - Catalog case `U05.order` pins `rules.U05.transfer-schema`,
    `rules.U05.legacy-actor`, `rules.U05.old-record`, `rules.U05.actor-scope`
    and `rules.U05.ruleset-version` in `src/lib/characterless-transfers.test.ts`,
    and `rules.U05.persistence` in
    `convex/characterlessTransfers.integration.test.ts`.
  - Delete the actor-specific ones and drop them from the case, or rewrite
    them to actorless only. Keep `rules.U05.characterless`, `U05.order`,
    `U05.overdraft` and `U05.officer-exception`.
  - Also affected:
    - `src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/upkeep-transfer-sections.test.ts`:
      "a legacy row keeps its recorded name" in `UPK-10.rows`.
    - `src/components/historical-week/record-roll-compatibility.test.tsx`:
      `HIST-05.old-source`.
    - The transfer actor in `tests/history/resolution-record-fixtures.ts`.
- **Order:** the schema narrows `canonicalWeeklyDraft`, operations and records
  together. Production holds no transfers.
- **Risk:** low. Behavior is unchanged, because the actor was already
  metadata only.
- **Size:** about 45 source lines and about 400 test lines.

### A4. Legacy Upkeep Remove decisions (#156)

- **Old shape:** an Upkeep team decision `'remove'` with an
  `upkeep-team-removal` Rules Exception. Since #156 removing a team is a Militia
  Correction, and Upkeep offers only Recover or Leave disabled.
- **Where:**
  - Schema: `'remove'` in the `teamDecisions` enum in
    `src/lib/weekly-draft-contract.ts`.
  - Engine: `removeWithException` and its call in `src/lib/rules-upkeep.ts`,
    with the `upkeep-removal` warning and `removal-exception` requirement.
    `removeTeam` stays, because the missing-team natural-1 loss uses it.
  - UI (`src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/`):
    - `legacyRemoval` in `upkeep-sections.ts`
    - `UpkeepLegacyRemoval` and the `legacyRemoval` fields in `types.ts`
    - `LegacyRemoval` in `upkeep-teams.tsx`
    - the `removal` parameter of `clearTeamDecision` in `upkeep-edits.ts`
    - `'removal-exception'` in `summary-messages.ts`
    - `:upkeep-removal` in `upkeep-warnings.ts`
- **Writers:** none in the UI. `e2e/support/team-conditions.ts`
  (`exerciseTeamConditionRows`) sends a `'remove'` decision through the
  transport on purpose, to show the repair row.
- **Tests and tags:**
  - `[rules.U04.recovery-inputs]` in `src/lib/rules-upkeep.test.ts` is pinned
    twice in the catalog. Keep the ID and delete its Remove half.
  - In `src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/`:
    - `upkeep-view.test.tsx`: "a retained Remove choice is cleared with its
      ruling…"
    - `upkeep-sections.test.ts`: "a retained Remove choice from an older page…"
    - the Remove fixtures in `phase-readiness.test.ts`
  - The Remove step in the e2e helper above.
- **Order:** the schema narrows drafts and operations. There is no record
  impact.
- **Risk:** low. The engine loses a branch only unreachable input could use
  (see the Ruleset Version rule above).
- **Size:** about 90 source lines and about 150 test lines.

### A5. Older Resolution Record formats and missing source snapshots (#194, #185, #197)

- **Old shape:** records written before canonical Weekly Resolution (#78) made
  every record format 2 with `sourceMilitiaSnapshot`. Those older records hold:
  - loose extraction facts under `formatVersion` 1, which may be keyed by
    phase, put the militia under `outcome` or record flat militia values;
  - no source snapshot;
  - written warning messages in place of codes;
  - no Activity plan.

  Confirmation has written only format 2 with a snapshot since #78, and
  production has no records at all.

- **Where:**
  - Schema: `src/lib/canonical-resolution-record.ts`.
    - `sourceMilitiaSnapshot` is `.optional()`; it could be required.
    - `resolutionArtifactSchema.formatVersion` is `int.min(1)`; it could be
      `z.literal(2)`. Typed plan schemas would be an optional further step.
  - `src/components/historical-week/record-artifacts.ts`:
    - the format test in `parseTypedPlan`, and `looseState`, `looseFinal` and
      the loose branches of `finalState` and `readRecordedWeek`;
    - the `baselinePlan.before` fallback for a missing snapshot.
  - `src/components/historical-week/record-review.ts`:
    - the no-Activity-plan fallback in `guaranteedChoices`;
    - the written-message branch of `findWarningCode` and `placeWarnings`;
    - `notRecordedText` and the `incomplete` status in `sectionStatus`;
    - `historicalMessages` (the old buyoff warning, see B1d).
  - `src/components/week-review/review-comparison.ts`: `recordedFacts`, the
    `recorded` part of `ComparedState`, and the "Not recorded" cells a complete
    format-2 record never needs. Keep `unrecorded` if C7's tolerance keeps
    using it.
  - `src/lib/finished-week-headlines.ts`: the `outcome` and flat-fact branches
    of `readFinalMilitia`, and the plan fallback of `readBeforeMilitia`. These
    feed `projectHeadlineFacts`, which `convex/canonicalHistory.ts` serves
    (#197).
- **Tests and tags:**
  - `tests/history/resolution-record-fixtures.ts`: `legacyRecord` and
    `legacySource`, about 200 of its 283 lines.
  - `src/components/historical-week/record-review.test.ts`:
    `HIST-05.frozen-legacy` and `HIST-05.frozen-rolls`. The rolls test belongs
    with A2.
  - `src/components/historical-week/record-review-view.test.tsx`:
    `HIST-05.frozen-view-legacy`.
  - `src/components/week-review/review-comparison.test.ts`: "a state that did
    not record its militia…".
  - `src/lib/finished-week-headlines.test.ts`: `P86.headline-legacy`.
  - None of these is catalog-pinned. The catalog does pin `rules.P86.display`
    and `rules.P86.labels` (`record-view.test.tsx`), whose record fixture holds
    `formatVersion: 1` loose facts. Rewrite that fixture as a format-2 record,
    for example from `confirmedWeek`, and keep both IDs.
- **Order:** the reader deletions need no schema change. Making the record
  schema stricter validates every stored record, so check dev history first
  (see A7).
- **Risk:** none in production today. The first release Confirmation writes
  format 2 at version 8, which this change keeps reading.
- **Size:** about 190 source lines and about 650 test lines.

### A6. Pre-Version-8 blank Hit Dice: "Hit Dice not recorded" (#196, #185)

- **Old shape:** a Resolution Record confirmed before Ruleset Version 8, when a
  blank roster Hit Dice override meant unknown rather than the character's
  level.
- **Not legacy:** the nullable `hitDice` override itself (`rosterPersonSchema`
  in `src/lib/canonical-roster.ts`). A blank means "use level" today, and
  `getEffectiveHitDice` reads it. See C3.
- **Where:**
  - `isBlankHitDiceLevel` in `src/lib/ruleset-versions.ts`, and its call in
    `recordWeekReview` (`src/components/historical-week/record-review.ts`).
  - `StateReading.isBlankHitDiceLevel` and the "not recorded" variant in
    `hitDiceText`, in `src/components/week-review/review-comparison.ts`.
- **Tests and tags:** `[rules.HIST-05.record-hit-dice]`
  (`record-review.test.ts`) is pinned in the Commandant case (`O03.success`).
  Rewrite it to assert blank as level, or drop it from the case.
  `HIST-05.record-kinds` (`record-view.test.tsx`, not pinned) asserts "Hit Dice
  not recorded".
- **Order:** none.
- **Risk:** safe once no record older than Version 8 exists, which is true in
  production now.
- **Size:** about 20 source lines and about 40 test lines.

### A7. Named Ruleset Version constants and pre-v8 record tests (#158, #191, #196)

- **Old shape:** none. No resolver branches on version: there is one Weekly
  Resolution, and records only store the number.
  - The constants `CHARACTERLESS_TRANSFERS_RULESET_VERSION` (6) and
    `CANDIDATE_REROLL_RULESET_VERSION` (7) exist to define 8 and to let tests
    build older records.
  - `ROLE_AWARE_OFFICERS_RULESET_VERSION` (8) is used by `isBlankHitDiceLevel`
    (A6).
- **Where:**
  - `src/lib/ruleset-versions.ts`.
  - The re-exports in `src/lib/canonical-weekly-resolution.ts`.
- **Tests and tags:** these catalog-pinned tests build or assert pre-v8
  records:
  - `rules.U05.ruleset-version` (`src/lib/characterless-transfers.test.ts`)
  - `rules.A10.reroll-version` (`src/lib/candidate-roll-twice.test.ts`)
  - `rules.HIST-05.manager-limit-version` and
    `rules.HIST-05.candidate-expansion` (`record-review.test.ts`)

  Others use an arbitrary small `rulesetVersion` as display data, for example
  `record-view.test.tsx` and `finished-week-index.test.ts`. They can stay.

- **Order:** after A6. Keep `CANONICAL_WEEKLY_RULESET_VERSION` at its current
  number (9 since #198, `ASSUMED_PROPAGANDA_APPROVAL_RULESET_VERSION`).
- **Risk:** none for data. Collapsing the constants must not reset the number.
- **Size:** about 15 source lines and about 200 test lines.

### A8. Off-list rank-boon feat text (#157)

- **Old shape:** a rank-boon acknowledgement (`upkeep:boon:<rank>:<characterId>`)
  whose outcome is free text rather than one of the offered feats, written by
  the open text field used before #157's feat cards. Feat boons now write only
  the chosen card.
  Open boons (Skilled, Gift, XP, Champion) still use free text, and that stays.
- **Where:** `feats.legacyOutcome` in
  `src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/upkeep-rank.ts`, and its block in
  `upkeep-rank-view.tsx` (the `OutcomeEditor` reuse for feat boons).
- **Tests and tags:** "a chosen feat card … off-list text stays a legacy
  outcome" (`upkeep-rank.test.ts`, not pinned).
- **Risk:** production has no acknowledgements. Confirm first that no other
  `acknowledge` writer targets `upkeep:boon:` subjects.
  - Writers today: `upkeep-rank.ts`, `use-event-edits.ts`, `sabotage-edits.ts`
    and `event-occurrence-editors.tsx`.
  - Only `upkeep-rank.ts` writes boon subjects.
- **Size:** about 25 source lines and about 20 test lines.

### A9. Legacy and absent character kinds in stored data (#179, #180)

- **Old shape:** a character record with `kind: 'officer_npc'` or no `kind`,
  and a roster person with `officer_npc` or `other_npc`. #179 widened readers
  to accept them. Since #180 every writer stores only `pc` or `npc`:
  - the character dialog offers `CHARACTER_KINDS`
    (`src/components/character-manager/character-form-card.tsx`);
  - `createCharacter` and `updateCharacter` (`convex/character.ts`) store
    `normalizeCharacterKind` of what they receive;
  - Setup and Militia corrections take each person's kind from their record
    (`src/lib/setup-characters.ts`, `src/components/militia-setup/roster.tsx`),
    and the server re-mirrors every roster kind from the campaign's records
    before storing a live source (`withCurrentRecordKinds` and
    `updateCanonicalCharacter` in `convex/lib/canonicalCharacters.ts`, called
    from `convex/canonicalSetup.ts` and `convex/canonicalLedger.ts`);
  - the e2e seed `convex/e2eFixtures.ts` writes `pc` or `npc`.

  The legacy values are now read-only. Production holds none: all six records
  and roster entries are `pc`, and there are no Resolution Records. So no
  live-row migration is needed, and none is planned (#181 was closed as not
  planned).

- **Where:**
  - `CHARACTER_RECORD_KINDS` and `ROSTER_KINDS` in `src/lib/character-kind.ts`
    could become `CHARACTER_KINDS`. The legacy and `undefined` branches of
    `normalizeCharacterKind`, `mirrorRosterKinds` and `formatCharacterKind`
    would then reduce to identity, and `getTeamManagerLimit`
    (`src/lib/team-manager-rules.ts`) could read `kind` directly.
  - `characterKindValidator` in `convex/schema.ts`, and
    `kind: v.optional(characterKindValidator)` in `characterValidator`, which
    could be required.
  - `rosterPersonSchema.kind` in `src/lib/canonical-roster.ts`. It reaches
    `canonicalMilitiaState` snapshots and every record's
    `sourceMilitiaSnapshot` and stored states.
  - `personKinds` in `src/components/week-review/review-comparison.ts`, which
    keeps "Officer NPC" and "Other NPC" wording for recorded history.
- **Writers of the old shape still in the tree:**
  `convex/lib/acceptedCampaignFixture.ts` inserts a character with no `kind`.
  `tests/rules/foundation-acceptance-fixtures.ts`,
  `tests/rules/character-kind-fixture.ts` and
  `tests/rules/compound-acceptance-fixture.ts` use legacy kinds. About 20 test
  files mention one.
- **Tests and tags:**
  - `src/lib/character-kind.test.ts`: "stored kind schemas accept legacy…" and
    "live normalization maps both legacy NPC labels…".
  - `src/lib/character-kind-compatibility.test.ts`: most of its seven tests.
  - `convex/characterKindCompatibility.integration.test.ts`: the legacy
    submission and "history keeps the recorded kinds" cases. Keep its mirror
    tests, with `pc`/`npc` data.
  - `HIST-05.record-kinds`
    (`src/components/historical-week/record-view.test.tsx`).
  - Catalog-pinned `rules.O06.role-aware-parity`
    (`convex/canonicalResolutionPreview.integration.test.ts`) iterates `pc`,
    `officer_npc`, `other_npc` and `npc`. Reduce it to `pc` and `npc` and keep
    its ID.
- **Order:** check dev and kept previews for legacy or absent kinds in
  `character`, `canonicalMilitiaState` and `canonicalResolutionRecord`. Then
  narrow the enums and delete the branches in one deploy. The same validators
  check write arguments; see B3 for browsers still on a pre-#180 bundle.
- **Risk:** low. Production needs no rewrite, only narrowing.
- **Size:** about 40 source lines and about 600 test lines.

### A10. Setup envelope version 1 migration (#173, #180)

- **Old shape:** an unfinished Setup stored in a browser at envelope version 1,
  with legacy roster kinds. Since #180 `SETUP_ENVELOPE_VERSION` is 2, and
  `parseSetupEnvelope` still reads version 1:
  - `withNormalizedKinds` maps both legacy labels to `npc`;
  - an unacknowledged version-1 start (`submitted`) is kept verbatim, so a
    same-identity retry still matches what the server accepted.
- **Where:** `src/lib/setup-envelope.ts`: `z.literal(1)` in the `version`
  union of `envelopeSchema`, `withNormalizedKinds`, and the version-1 notes in
  the file header. `docs/canonical-militia-setup.md` describes the migration.
- **Tests and tags:**
  - `[setup.resume.migrate-kinds]` and `[setup.resume.migrate-records]` in
    `src/lib/setup-envelope.test.ts`.
  - `[setup.resume.migrate]` and `[setup.resume.migrate-unacknowledged]` in
    `src/components/militia-setup/screen.test.tsx`.
  - None is catalog-pinned. `[setup.resume.migrate-wait]` tests restoring
    after records load, which is not specific to version 1, and stays.
- **Order:** none of it reaches the server. Removing it with A9 keeps the
  parser and the kinds consistent.
- **Risk:** envelopes live in each player's `localStorage`, so no production
  check can see them. Production's only campaign already has its militia, and
  starting Setup retires its envelope, so no production Setup can be
  unfinished. At worst a version-1 envelope in some browser is discarded
  instead of migrated.
- **Size:** about 35 source lines and about 250 test lines.

## B. Safe once a condition holds

### B1. Older Event and check-decision fields (#164–#168)

**Removed 2026-09-29 (#198)** once W1 was narrowed. Also rewritten:
`O04.persistent-selection` (it relied on same-week decision support).

**Condition: W1 is retired or narrowed.** The per-family Event controls and the
Persistent page never write these fields. The generic Event details editor
still can, because it edits the full `eventOccurrenceSchema`, including
`occurrence.persistentDecision`. Production holds none of them today. Once W1
stops offering them, each part below is safe.

**B1a. Event-level mitigation on Raid and Cache Discovered (#164, #165)**

- **Old shape:** `occurrence.mitigation` and `occurrence.rolls.check` standing
  in for every hidden person or cache. Current controls write per-target
  `targetChecks[]`. Event-level mitigation remains current for Theft.
- **Where:**
  - Engine:
    - the `?? event.mitigation` and `?? event.rolls?.check` fallbacks in
      `checkThreatMitigation` (`src/lib/rules-threat-events.ts`);
    - the target fallback in `eventMitigationInput`
      (`src/lib/rules-event-checks.ts`).
  - UI (`src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/`):
    - `legacyMitigation` and `legacyCheckRoll` in `event-target-facts.ts`,
      `event-resource-facts.ts` (with `legacyRoll`) and `types.ts`;
    - the notes in `event-raid-inputs.tsx` and `event-resource-inputs.tsx`;
    - `clearEventMitigation` in `use-event-edits.ts`.
- **Tests:**
  - Catalog-pinned `rules.EV03.mitigate` and `rules.EV03.inputs`
    (`src/lib/rules-threat-events.test.ts`) use event-level cache mitigation as
    their scenario. Rewrite them to `targetChecks` and keep their IDs.
  - `EVT-08.raid-legacy` (`event-target-facts.test.ts`) and
    `EVT-07.cache-retained` (`event-resource-facts.test.ts`) are not pinned.

**B1b. Overseer support on a target, reaction or same-week decision (#164, #166)**

- **Old shape:** `targetChecks[].overseerCharacterId`,
  `sabotage.overseerCharacterId` and a same-week
  `persistentDecision.overseerCharacterId`. Current support lives only on the
  occurrence's own `overseerCharacterId` or on a carried event's mitigation
  decision.
- **Where:**
  - `eventOverseerSelection` in `src/lib/rules-overseer-event.ts`.
  - In `src/lib/overseer-support.ts`: the `target`, `reaction` and
    `same-week-decision` locations in `occurrenceSelections`,
    `withoutSupport` and `assignOverseerSupportEdit`.
  - `LegacyOverseerNote` (`event-legacy-overseer-note.tsx`) and its uses in
    `event-check-row.tsx`, `event-cache-target.tsx` and `event-raid-person.tsx`.
  - The `overseer: null` patch in `use-event-edits.ts`, and the related field
    in `types.ts`.
- **Tests:**
  - Catalog-pinned `rules.O04.event-scope` (`rules-threat-events.test.ts`)
    selects support on a reaction and a later target. Reduce it to the
    occurrence selection and keep its ID.
  - `rules.EVT-10.overseer-holders` (`src/lib/overseer-support.test.ts`) and
    `EVT-10.overseer-legacy` (`overseer-support-view.test.tsx`) are not pinned.

**B1c. Acknowledgements nested in a Sabotage reaction (#166)**

- **Old shape:** `sabotage.acknowledgements`. Current notes are draft-level
  acknowledgements with subject `sabotage:<event>:<choice>`.
- **Where:**
  - `recordSabotageOutcome` in `src/lib/rules-event-shaping.ts`.
  - `nestedAcknowledgement` in `event-sabotage-facts.ts`, and its two
    branches in `sabotage-edits.ts`.
  - The `occurrence.sabotage.acknowledgements` read in `recordedOutcomes`
    (`record-review.ts`).
  - The schema field in `src/lib/weekly-draft-facts.ts`.
- **Tests:** the shared fixture `tests/rules/event-action-fixture.ts` nests one.
  Move it to `draft.acknowledgements`, which many pinned event tests use. Also
  `rules-threat-events.test.ts` (`O04.event-scope`), `rules-event-actions.test.ts`,
  `event-sabotage.test.tsx` and `event-view.test.tsx`.

**B1d. Stored buyoff amounts: `costCopper` (#167)**

- **Old shape:** a `buyoff` Persistent decision with `costCopper`. Since #167
  Buy off is amount-free at the rules cost. The same-week
  `occurrence.persistentDecision` reaches the same engine
  (`rules-persistent-events.ts` collects both), which is why W1 still matters.
- **Where:**
  - `costCopper` on the `buyoff` member of `persistentDecisionSchema`
    (`src/lib/weekly-draft-facts.ts`).
  - The `buyoff-cost-recomputed` warning in `applyPersistentBuyoff`
    (`src/lib/rules-persistent-events.ts`).
  - `removedLiveWarnings` in `persistent-sections.ts`.
  - `historicalMessages` and the "Recorded buyoff amount" line of
    `decisionDetails` in `record-review.ts`.
- **Tests:**
  - `[PER-05.legacy] [rules.P84.legacy-amount]` in `persistent-view.test.tsx`
    is pinned by case `P04.persistent-preparation` in both `plannedTests` and
    `tests`. Remove it there, next to the comment "P84.copper retired by #167".
  - `PER-05.legacy` in `persistent-facts.test.ts`.
  - The warning in `tests/history/resolution-record-fixtures.ts`.

**B1e. Unused fields on check decisions and occurrences (#168, #164)**

- **Old shape:**
  - `strategistCharacterId` on occurrences and mitigation decisions. No rule
    reads it; only the reference check in `src/lib/weekly-draft-references.ts`
    does.
  - `targets` on a carried mitigation decision.
  - A `mitigate` decision on a carried event without a check, such as Low
    Morale.
- **Where:**
  - `retainedFields` in `persistent-check-facts.ts`, and `RetainedDetails` in
    `persistent-retained-details.tsx`.
  - The "This saved check isn't available" message in `persistent-view.tsx`.
  - The two schema fields.
- **Tests:** `PER-03.legacy` (`persistent-view.test.tsx`, not pinned), and
  seven test lines that set `strategistCharacterId`.

**B1, all parts**

- **Order:** retire or narrow W1, then re-check drafts, then narrow the schema
  fields and delete the fallbacks in one deploy. The fields sit in
  `eventOccurrenceSchema` and `persistentDecisionSchema`, which records also
  embed.
- **Size:** about 260 source lines and about 500 test lines, plus the shared
  fixture changes.

### B2. Candidate Roll Twice expansions and replacement-child rerolls (#191, #163)

**Removed 2026-09-29 (#198)**, reroll groups everywhere (rolled tree and
automatic events too). Also rewritten: `E03.nested`, `E04.reroll`,
`E04.independent`, `A10.reroll-parity`.

**Condition: W2 (the Activity candidate-tree editor) is retired.** It can still
write candidate trees with any `origin`. The parallel fixes batch retires it;
once that lands, this entry is safe given the production facts (no stored
choices), and needs only the draft re-check below.

- **Old shape:** two kinds of child in Activity candidate sets:
  - `roll_twice` children, from before Ruleset Version 7. Since then a
    candidate's Roll Twice is rerolled in its own die. These children show as
    **No longer used**.
  - `replacement` children recorded as a Roll Twice reroll (`reroll: true`
    groups), including on automatic events. This is "an older client's
    representation of that reroll".
- **Not legacy:** replacement children for an event that cannot occur. They are
  current.
- **Where:**
  - `isLegacyCandidateExpansion`, and its use in `isSurplusEventOccurrence`, in
    `src/lib/event-occurrence-preparation.ts`.
  - In `src/lib/rules-event-selection.ts`: child matching for reroll groups in
    `selectOccurrence` and `validateCandidate`, and the
    `EventPositionGroup.reroll` comment.
  - In `src/components/weekly-draft-workspace/`:
    - `event-tree-facts.ts`: the `legacy` status and label and `nested.legacy`
    - `EventBlock.legacy` in `types.ts`
    - the "…no longer used" disclosure in `event-block.tsx`
    - `nestedCount` in `activity-candidate-facts.ts`
    - the `block.legacy` walk in `use-event-edits.ts`
    - `event-view-test-fixture.ts`
- **Tests:**
  - Pinned in catalog case `A10.roll-twice`, whose `expected` also says
    "earlier expansions stay recorded and unused":
    - `rules.A10.reroll-before-after` and `rules.A10.reroll-representation`
      (`src/lib/candidate-roll-twice.test.ts`);
    - `rules.A10.roll-twice` (`src/lib/rules-event-actions.test.ts`), which
      should keep its ID and drop the "older expansion children" half;
    - `rules.HIST-05.candidate-expansion` (A7).
  - Not pinned: `EVT-13.candidate-legacy` (`event-occurrence-preparation.test.ts`)
    and `EVT-13.candidate-legacy-view` (`event-facts.test.ts`).
- **Order:** W2 first, then check drafts, then the engine and UI deletion.
- **Risk:** low. The surplus machinery itself stays (C1).
- **Size:** about 70 source lines and about 250 test lines.

### B3. Old-client kind submissions (#180)

**Condition: no browser still runs a bundle from before #180.** This is the
write side of A9. The production release that carries #180 replaces a bundle
whose forms still send `officer_npc`, and a tab left open across that release
keeps sending it until reloaded.

- **Old shape:** a write argument that carries a legacy kind:
  - `createCharacter` or `updateCharacter` with `officer_npc`;
  - a Setup start or Militia correction whose roster holds `officer_npc` or
    `other_npc`, including a version-1 Setup envelope's unacknowledged start,
    which A10 resends verbatim.
- **Where:** the arguments reuse the stored validators, so they accept legacy
  kinds today and normalize them:
  - `characterKindValidator` in the argument objects of `convex/character.ts`,
    next to the "Old clients may still send officer_npc" normalization;
  - the `militiaSetupSchema` roster kinds accepted by `convex/canonicalSetup.ts`
    and `convex/canonicalLedger.ts`, which `withCurrentRecordKinds` then
    re-mirrors.
- **Tests:** "record APIs store PC or NPC for legacy submissions…" in
  `convex/characterKindCompatibility.integration.test.ts`.
- **Order:** narrow with A9. If a stale tab's write should be normalized rather
  than refused, keep the argument validators wide for one release after #180
  reaches production, and narrow only storage first.
- **Risk:** low. A refused write shows the ordinary save failure, and reloading
  fixes it.
- **Size:** about 15 source lines and about 100 test lines.

### B4. Pre-canonical character fields and the `dataMigration` table (#16, #17)

**Condition: a read-only check of the documents in every kept deployment.** The
2026-09-28 production check did not report these.

- **Old shape:**
  - `ownerId` stored as a number. The comment says: "Widened during ownerId
    migration. Narrow back to v.string() after backfill."
  - `isActive` absent, read as active by `isActive !== false` in
    `convex/character.ts`, `convex/canonicalSetup.ts`,
    `convex/lib/canonicalCharacters.ts`, `src/components/character-manager.tsx`
    and `src/components/use-canonical-ledger.ts`. Every writer sets it.
  - The `dataMigration` table and `dataMigrationValidator`. Nothing reads or
    writes them.
- **Where:** `characterValidator` and `dataMigration` in `convex/schema.ts`.
- **Order:** backfill or confirm, then narrow. Clear the `dataMigration` table
  in each deployment before dropping it from the schema, as #91 cleared its
  tables before narrowing.
- **Size:** about 30 lines.

### B5. #91 rejection endpoint names

**Condition: no pre-cutover browser bundle or operator script can still call
them.** Cutover was 2026-09-24. Old-backup recovery uses release `b249911`, not
this release, so the backup retention window through 2026-10-08 does not depend
on these names.

- **Old shape:** calls to the retired board and migration functions.
- **Where:**
  - Every export of `convex/militia.ts`, `convex/weekBoard.ts`,
    `convex/migrations.ts` and `convex/legacyRetirement.ts`.
  - The internal functions of `convex/cutover.ts`.
  - `rejectRetiredWorkflow` in `convex/lib/retiredWorkflow.ts`.
- **Keep:** `cutover.status`, which `maintenance-banner.tsx` uses, the
  `readCutover` write gate in `convex/lib/campaignRuntime.ts` and the
  `campaignCutover` and initialization receipt tables. They are the maintenance
  gate and the audit evidence.
- **Tests and tags:**
  - `[retirement.reject]` (`convex/legacyRetirement.integration.test.ts`) and
    `[retirement.preserve]` (`convex/acceptedCampaign.integration.test.ts`) are
    mapped by case `P11.legacy` with `serviceTests: ['live.cutover']`.
  - Retiring the names changes that case. Its `expected` text and the
    fingerprinted case inventory need a reviewed update, and the e2e cutover
    journey's retired-path checks change too.
- **Size:** about 290 source lines and about 30 test lines.

---

## C. Keep

### C1. Surplus positions and "Needs repair" (#163)

Surplus positions are over-full groups and automatic events whose source is not
due. They show as **Needs repair** and can be removed once empty through
`isSurplusEventOccurrence` and `removableEventOccurrence`
(`src/lib/event-occurrence-preparation.ts`) and `tree.block`
(`event-tree-facts.ts`).

- **Why keep:** current play still produces them. Preparation only fills
  (`d550d47`), so changing a chance roll, table roll or queued effect after
  positions exist leaves extras behind.
- The "legacy roots" left by the removed manual add buttons use the same path.
- Tests: `EVT-13.legacy` and `EVT-13.repair`.
- Only B2's candidate-expansion branch is removable.

### C2. Retained unused fields in Activity and Event; the candidate-tree editor

- **Why keep:** values a mode or type change leaves unused stay visible and
  removable, and the current editors create them:
  - Activity: `RetainedClear` (`activity-mission-fields.tsx`), and
    `retainedPlace` and `retainedItem` (`activity-economy-detail.ts`).
  - Event: `retainedFields` and `EventRetainedInputs`.
  - Persistent: retained targets, except B1e.
- Recorded modifiers of unknown source can be removed by position
  (`removeModifierEdit` in `activity-board.ts`, `ActivityModifierList`). They
  come from the generic modifier editor in `activity-details.tsx`.
- The Activity host lists any choice acknowledgement that no per-action editor
  owns ("older notes still listed by the host", #190, in `ActivityDetails`).
  Required acknowledgements use the same list, so it stays.
- The **Recorded candidate details** editor (W2) is being retired by the
  parallel fixes batch, which had not landed at `76a7b23`. Its retirement
  unblocks B2 and removes one writer of B1's nested shapes. B1 still waits on
  W1, the Event details editor.

### C3. Current look-alikes

Each of these looks like old data but is written today.

- **Nullable `hitDice`:** blank means the level (`getEffectiveHitDice`). It is
  not legacy.
- **Recovery `costCopper` on Upkeep team decisions:** `recoverTeam` in
  `upkeep-edits.ts` writes the rules cost.
- **Activity `costCopper`:** the editable cost field in
  `activity-detail-parts.tsx`; Special requires it. The `calculated-cost` and
  `recovery-cost-baseline` warnings for a differing cost are current too.
- **`upkeep_team` rolls on `leave` decisions:** the missing-team return check.

### C4. The `blocked` team status

`TEAM_STATUSES` (`src/lib/militia-domain.ts`) includes `blocked`, and Setup's
roster (`src/components/militia-setup/roster.tsx`) still offers it. It is
current data. The summary adjustment form keeps offering it only to an
adjustment that already records it (`summary-adjustment-form.ts`), and that
behavior should follow any future decision about the status itself.

### C5. Legacy addresses and week links

- **Why keep:** these are bookmarks, not stored data, and they cost little.
  - `legacyRedirectTarget` (`src/components/campaign-shell/legacy-redirect.ts`)
    and `legacyCampaignPath` (`src/lib/campaign-routes.ts`).
  - The `/canonical-workspace`, `/canonical-setup` and `/canonical-history`
    pages.
  - The `legacy-addresses` and `legacy-week-links` journeys.
- If they are ever removed, move `decodeCampaignId` out of `legacy-redirect.ts`
  first, because current routes import it.

### C6. Ruleset Version numbers in the corpus and history

The version notes in `docs/ai/ironfang-militia/militia-rules.md` (versions 6, 7
and 8) and the stored number 8 stay. See the rules at the top.

### C7. Frozen-record tolerance for unfamiliar entries

`describeRecordedChange` (`src/components/week-review/review-changes.ts`), the
`try` in `sectionChips` and the `generic` fact text keep a record readable when
a plan entry has a shape the current readers do not know.

- **Why keep:** after release, every future change to a plan entry's shape
  meets immutable version-8 records.
- Remove only the format-1 and missing-snapshot paths (A5).

## Documentation to update with each removal

- `docs/ui-capability-inventory.md` rows describe the older-data behavior:
  - NAV-03 and NAV-17 (C5)
  - WEEK-15 and WEEK-16 (A2)
  - UPK-08 (A8) and UPK-10 (A3)
  - ACT-14 (C2)
  - EVT-04, EVT-08, EVT-10 and EVT-13 (B1, B2)
  - PER-05 (B1d)
  - SUM-08 (C4)
  - HIST-05 (A5, A6)
- The entry notes above that table, for #179, #180, #194 and #185, name the
  fixtures.
- `docs/canonical-militia-setup.md`: the kind and envelope paragraphs (A9,
  A10).
- `docs/weekly-draft-contract.md`: the #180 paragraph on relabelled kinds
  (A9).
- `tests/rules/README.md`, "Upkeep extraction": the transfer-actor paragraph
  (A3).
- `docs/canonical-weekly-resolution.md` still says Confirmation "stays isolated
  until the approved cutover" and that format 2 uses "ruleset version 2". Both
  are stale. Correct them when A5 lands.
