# Spec review brief (PRD #251 run)

**Review scope:** the full declared support boundary, unless a fix-round section at the end of this brief narrows it. Broader unfinished acceptance stays with its owner unless a launch dependency or regression is demonstrated.

For an initial review, use `git -C <WT> diff <BASE>...<COMMIT>` in <WT>. Review exactly `<COMMIT>`.

The spec is the ticket (`gh issue view <N>`) and the parent PRD (`gh issue view 251`), including the Implementation Decisions it cites and the acceptance appendix comment. Also check `<WT>/docs/pf-character-sheet-data-model.md` (an index; open the section files in `<WT>/docs/character-sheet/` it links), `<WT>/GLOSSARY.md` and `<WT>/docs/adr/`. The design-decision issues #201–#250 can be read with `gh issue view` (later resolutions override earlier ones).

Report:
- (a) required work that is missing or only partly done;
- (b) scope creep;
- (c) code that looks implemented but is wrong, including authorization holes, broken invariants and untested acceptance criteria;
- (d) if visuals changed, QA by reading the code against the approved prototype tag (`git -C <WT> show prototype-approved/<name>:<path>`).

You may run single test files read-only with `pnpm test <path>` in <WT>. Quote the spec line for each finding. Number the findings, mark each blocker, should-fix or nit, and keep the report under 400 words. Parent-disposed deferrals appear once under Carried, never as findings.

You may answer "LAND once X is fixed" only when X is machine-checkable, for example a stale count or a commit message; say how to check it (the command or the expected value), name the reviewed commit's full SHA, and name exactly what the repair may change: the files, or "the commit message". The gate lands the repair only when it changes exactly those. Any other finding that must be fixed before landing gets an ordinary fix round. This review covers Spec only; Standards is a separate review.

Save the report to `<ORCH>/briefs/<N>-review-spec.out.md` before you finish.
