# Militia rules review — one-document checklist

Prepared for issue #88 on 2026-09-19, from implementation `bd057df`. **Human review: complete — AndreasUnunger, 2026-09-23.** Existing review marks are preserved. This is the document to read and reply to; the rule text, numeric tables, accepted policies, expected behavior, and open decisions are included here.

## Recorded scope decisions

2026-09-23 — You removed `F02.ap-caps` from scope: no current Adventure Path or volume is tracked, and no volume-based rank limit is calculated, displayed, or enforced. Rank 20 and the highest-PC-level limit remain. The removed item needs no further review.

2026-09-23 — **F04.context is deferred** to [backlog issue #98](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/98): handling extra actions granted by story rewards. It does not block this review and needs no further reply. Rank and Strategist allowance checks remain in scope.

2026-09-23 — **F05.order:** You specified that recruitment and dismissal committed in the same week must work in either order when the resulting roster fits team capacity. This supersedes the earlier slot-by-slot capacity expectation.

2026-09-23 — **O02.*:** You specified automatic use of the highest applicable officer bonus, with no manual ability or bonus selection. Multiple holders do not stack their bonuses.

2026-09-23 — **O04:** The supplied Overseer rule permits support for organization checks throughout one event’s resolution, not only one check. The +1 bonus to both secondary checks remains.

2026-09-23 — **O05.slot:** The Strategist’s +2 must be visibly labelled on its bonus action slot.

2026-09-23 — **U01.first-use:** You confirmed that the first-week Upkeep skip applies only to a newly founded militia’s first-ever week. A militia set up to resume a later week must run Upkeep, even when first starting in the app.

2026-09-23 — **A13.chooser:** You specified that any player can choose the guaranteed event result. The app does not need to track who chose it.

2026-09-23 — **P10.gm:** All users with organization access can edit everything. No separate GM controls or correction permissions apply at this stage; this supersedes historical GM-only policy below.

2026-09-23 — **P11.legacy:** No requests from the old version will arrive after the upgrade. Explicit legacy-request rejection and forced reload handling are out of scope. The paused cutover and recovery before reopening still need rehearsal; this supersedes conflicting historical cutover wording below.

## How to reply

Read a group’s included rule reference, then judge each numbered expectation: does it express the right behavior, including the named edge case? You are reviewing rules and intended behavior, not certifying code or rerunning tests. For implementation gaps, approval means the requirement is correct; it does not mean the missing work has been completed.

Reply here using `ID: OK`, `ID: CHANGE — correction`, or `ID: UNSURE — question`. For any explicit choices, use `ID: CHOICE A` or `ID: CHOICE B — details`. Send one group at a time if convenient.

```text
F01.fresh: OK
F01.import: CHANGE — [describe the behavior you want]
F01.rank-cap: UNSURE — [your question]
COMPLETE.F01: OK
```

If you have read every check in a group, you may say `A07.*: OK`. This covers its listed behavior checks; reply separately to `COMPLETE.A07` to confirm nothing is missing. Unmentioned checks remain pending. These are reply examples, not recorded approvals.

Each `COMPLETE.…` check asks whether the group omits any rule or important scenario. Report a missing behavior against that ID even when every existing check looks correct. Existing IDs are retained so your replies can be mapped directly to the coverage inventory.

Two terms used throughout: a **Rules Exception** permits an unusual choice with a recorded reason, without changing the calculated arithmetic. A **Table Adjustment** changes the result after the full rules baseline, with a recorded reason. **Confirmation** commits the complete reviewed week.

## Start here: accepted interpretation policy

The following previously accepted policies govern ambiguous wording and superseded behavior. They are reference material, not new approvals requested from you. The historical snapshots are reproduced so no other document is needed. The dated scope decisions above supersede conflicting historical wording below. In particular, Rules Exceptions cannot permit actions in unavailable slots. Flag any conflict you discover against the affected check.

Part of #33.

**Question**

Which mismatches found by **Audit Weekly Draft behavior against the full militia rules corpus**, if any, are intentional product exceptions rather than bugs?

The written militia rules are the default. For every proposed exception, decide the observable behavior, reason, Phase View or Resolution Preview effect, and required test. Treat every mismatch not explicitly accepted here as a bug to correct during the refactor.


**Resolution**

Accepted by the driving developer in the live Wayfinder discussion: “Sounds good” for policies 1–3, then “Go with recs” for interpretations 4–9 below. This is a planning decision, not an implementation report.

The evidence inventory is [Audit Weekly Draft behavior against the full militia rules corpus](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/54). Its 95 entries remain the coverage inventory; this resolution supplies the exception policy and interpretations for that inventory.

**Baseline and intentional product behavior**

No demonstrated legacy calculation bug is accepted merely to preserve current behavior. Every mismatch not explicitly covered by an accepted decision remains a bug to correct during the refactor. Missing models and tests remain required work; manual handling is not permission to silently omit an outcome. Previously accepted Workspace and lifecycle decisions remain in force.

| Decision | Accepted observable behavior and reason | Phase View / Resolution Preview effect | Required tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Correct baseline defects | Follow the written rules unless an explicit accepted interpretation below applies. In particular, rank 1 grants one baseline action; failed Dismiss Team still removes the team and adds rolled Notoriety. Existing tests asserting incorrect behavior must be replaced. | Show corrected action allowances and projected roster/results. | Rank boundaries and Strategist; failed dismissal removes the target and applies Notoriety; corrected outcomes for every mismatch in the audit. |
| 2. Computation and table adjudication | Calculate deterministic defaults from the rules. Players provide dice rolls and narrative adjudication. Narrative outcomes require explicit acknowledgement/recording; do not pretend that displaying instructions executes an outcome. Full character-builder and tactical-combat execution remain outside scope. This preserves table authority without hiding missing calculations. | Show the calculated baseline, missing rolls/acknowledgements, and explicit Table Adjustments separately. Include reward, boon, encounter, and support reminders with the prescribed quantities/conditions. | Raw-roll and modifier branches, including natural rolls; missing-input readiness; baseline versus adjusted result; narrative acknowledgement retained in the confirmed source/history; no double application of computed and entered outcomes. |
| 3. Rules Exceptions | Any player may retain an out-of-rules choice through a shared Rules Exception with a required reason, except that unavailable action slots cannot be bypassed. It permits the choice; it does not rewrite the calculated result. Missing required inputs and malformed data still block Confirmation. This supports table-valid exceptions while keeping departures visible. | Explain the eligibility warning and recorded exception. Apply typed Table Adjustments after the baseline when the result itself is changed. | Unavailable action slots block Confirmation even with a reason; other rule departures with/without a reason; exception visible to another player; malformed references/data and required missing inputs remain blocked; exception does not itself alter arithmetic; confirmed source retains the exception. |

**Accepted source interpretations and timing policy**

These are explicit project decisions where the audit identified ambiguity or a representation shortcut. They are not claims that every detail is unambiguously prescribed by the source.

| Decision / inventory | Accepted observable behavior and reason | Phase View / Resolution Preview effect | Required tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4. Uneventful carry — E05 | After an eligible uneventful week, add the current rank once to the following week's event **chance**, not to the percentile roll. Do not accumulate rank across consecutive quiet weeks. The verbatim Event Phase wording supports chance and does not explicitly prescribe accumulation. Preserve first-militia-week exclusion and the event-specific exclusions; automatic events count when deciding whether the week was uneventful. | Show one rank modifier and the resulting bounded 10–95% chance. | Consecutive quiet weeks do not accumulate; changing rank uses current rank; chance-versus-roll; 10/95 boundaries; first-use metadata; All Is Calm and Calm before the Storm/automatic-event exclusions. |
| 5. Duplicates without Twice — E04 and affected events | Resolve both occurrences separately when a duplicate has no Twice clause. Where a Twice clause exists, use it; explicit “no additional effect” still suppresses the additional effect. A duplicate is not automatically discarded. | Show both applicable outcomes/required inputs in order. Additional Roll Twice results require replacement rolls rather than disappearing. | Two no-clause occurrences, a replacement/enhancement Twice clause, explicit no-additional-effect clauses, repeated Roll Twice rerolls, independent targets/rolls and order-sensitive results. |
| 6. Persistent Double Agent — EV05 | Block Secure Cache every affected Activity phase until the persistent event ends; apply one −2 Secrecy penalty, not queued −2 plus persistent −2. This follows the general persistence rule that effects continue week after week. A nonpersistent occurrence blocks only the next Activity phase. | Explain ongoing eligibility and the single penalty; never silently discard a staged cache action. Rules Exception policy still applies. | Base next-week duration; first and later persistent weeks; no −4 double count; ending/buyoff removes future restriction and penalty; warning/exception path. |
| 7. Buyoff cadence — P03 | First buyoff is available immediately. Thereafter use one four-week cooldown shared across the militia's persistent events: buyoff in week 2 allows the next in week 6. Charge twice the current minimum treasury. This treats “once every 4 weeks” as a cooldown rather than a mandatory initial wait. | Show eligibility, next eligible week, cost, and staged end in the preview. Retain the accepted whole-week Confirmation lifecycle rather than immediate authoritative writes. | First use before week 4; weeks 2/5/6; different target events share cooldown; current-rank cost; two-player competing edits and Confirmation; insufficient funds use the agreed warning/exception policy. |
| 8. Special Order timing — A21 | Preserve actual delivery duration in days, including one-day expedited delivery, and record receipt explicitly. Do not silently round every order to a later week. Exact due-day information preserves the value of expediting. This policy does not change Broker Market's separate next-Activity timing rule. | Show due-day information and receipt status, with deterministic price/time defaults and entered dice. Receipt remains subject to the accepted draft/Confirmation lifecycle. | Ordinary 2d6 boundaries, one-day expedite and its surcharge, enchantment time, orders crossing week boundaries, explicit receipt recording and no duplicate receipt; Broker Market retains its distinct timing. |
| 9. Fractions — F09/A16/A23/EV19 and related numeric cases | Round whole-count results down, except Strike Team support has a minimum of one round (A23.rank-one review decision, 2026-09-23). Preserve money to copper precision; odd-level rescue Notoriety and split XP round down. | Show the rounded baseline and any explicit adjustment; preserve monetary precision. | Odd/even half-rank and half-level values, rank-1 minimum of one round, non-divisible XP awards, fractional treasury/price calculations at copper precision, and explicit adjustment paths. |

**Handoff**

The shared Rules Projection owns these baseline calculations and interpretations; Phase Views present them. The Weekly Draft retains the necessary rolls, choices, acknowledgements, Rules Exceptions, and Table Adjustments so the Resolution Preview and Confirmation use the same source. Preserve the established exact-revision Confirmation and immutable Resolution Record contracts.

Use the audit inventory to expand compound entries into executable rule/case coverage under [What test architecture should protect the Weekly Draft refactor?](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/53). In particular, replace legacy expectations for cumulative carry, suppressed no-clause duplicates, failed dismissal, and rank-one Strike Team support (now explicitly at least one round). Do not treat existing test success as proof of rules completeness.

The remaining migration-sequence decision must account for day-based orders, persistent-event targets/cadence, independent occurrences and rolls, complete calculated defaults, and recorded table decisions. Detailed exception/receipt presentation stays with implementation; no new planning ticket is needed for the accepted policies.

No application code, campaign data, deployment, or rules corpus changed. Existing local edits to AGENTS.md and CONTEXT.md were left intact. No tests were run because this session resolved planning policy only.

## Source section classifications — checked against the PDF

Reviewed by Codex on 2026-09-23 at your request, using printed pages **48–59** (PDF pages **50–61**) of *Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lands of Conflict*. The supplied attachment path was unavailable; the local copy has the same filename and exact size (12,813,042 bytes). Its SHA-256 is `63feb5f2ce74ce5017bda3436b4f18418f28f9e2719492fc8c334b9ed5d48b49`.

These five entries are organizational sections in the normalized rules document. Their classifications are complete; no further reply is needed for these SOURCE IDs. This records an agent source check, separate from your full human corpus sign-off recorded below. Your explicit product decisions elsewhere in this checklist still apply.

- [x] **SOURCE.R001 — Editorial introduction.** The title “Ironfang Invasion Militia Rules” and its sentence about searchable organization describe this repository document. The PDF instead begins “Building a Militia” on printed p. 48. This wrapper adds no separate rule. Campaign setup/scope are represented by F01/F02/F05 and the recorded scope decisions.

- [x] **SOURCE.R019 — Terminology grouping.** The normalized heading has no body before “Rank.” The PDF’s terminology spans printed pp. 48–51. Its actual rules are covered by the individual definitions and their checks: foundations F01–F07, manager rules O06, team/action access T01–T06, weekly order U01, and event/carry handling E01/E05/E06/P01. Tracking the militia weekly is already part of the workflow. No additional behavior is hidden in the parent heading.

- [x] **SOURCE.R163 — Team-condition grouping.** The Team Conditions box on printed p. 53 introduces disabled and missing teams. Its detailed rules are represented by T07/T08 and their child sources R165/R171; F05 covers team capacity. Those checks cover inability to act, recovery cost/timing, the return check, end-of-week return, and permanent loss on a natural 1. The parent heading adds no separate behavior.

- [x] **SOURCE.R178 — Team-tree grouping.** “Team Trees” groups the four branches shown on printed pp. 52–54. T01–T04 cover the individual branches; T05/T06 and the recruitment/upgrade action checks cover costs, inherited actions, and timing restrictions. This normalized parent heading adds no separate behavior.

- [x] **SOURCE.R217 — Upkeep grouping with rules represented elsewhere.** Printed p. 54’s introduction is not purely decorative: it states the first-ever-week skip and the fixed order of the five steps. U01 covers the skip/weekly sequence, U02–U04 cover attrition and penalties, U04/U05 cover advancement before transfers, and A07 covers Drill Militia. These requirements are already represented; the empty normalized parent heading needs no additional behavior case.

## Full accepted product and verification reference

These snapshots are included for the product/workflow checks above. They are historical specifications: the recorded scope decisions and corrected checks above supersede conflicting requirements here, including old-version request handling, GM-only controls, unavailable action slots, and Strike Team duration. Statements about implementation status at the time of the decision are not current verification results. Links are provenance only; the source text needed for this review is included here.

### Accepted product and workflow specification (#57)

**Problem Statement**

Players need to prepare an Ironfang militia week together, understand the consequences of their choices, and confirm exactly the week they reviewed. Today, Weekly Draft orchestration, browser input, shared edits, rules calculations, and persistence are spread across a large board controller, phase builders, and backend write paths. This makes changes difficult to reason about and allows lost edits, incomplete previews, and inconsistent rules outcomes.

The completed architecture map [#33](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/33) establishes the replacement architecture. This specification turns its accepted decisions into an implementation contract. The map's planning work is complete; implementation and eventual cutover are separate work described here.

**Solution**

Give the board one Weekly Draft Workspace interface that presents the current Phase View and accepts semantic edits and whole-week Confirmation. Players can jointly edit complete Staged Action Choices, navigate independently, see immediate feedback and rules-derived previews, and review explicit table decisions before committing the week atomically.

Use one typed Weekly Draft contract and one shared pure Rules Projection across the browser and Convex. Preserve useful existing presentation and observable behavior, correct unaccepted baseline defects, and retain accepted product interpretations explicitly. Replace live storage through the approved paused cutover while preserving authoritative campaign state and week context.

**User Stories**

1. As a player, I want the board to clearly show loading, unavailable, failed, and ready states, so that I understand whether I can work on my militia week.
2. As a player, I want to view Upkeep, Activity, Event, and Summary independently of other players, so that each person can inspect the information they need.
3. As a player, I want phase navigation to remain immediate while my edits are pending, so that preparation does not stall.
4. As a player, I want to see shared choices and accepted changes on every device, so that the table works from the same Weekly Draft.
5. As a player, I want immediate feedback for an edit and a clear recovery message if it fails, so that I know whether my work was retained.
6. As a player, I want edits to different targets to coexist and conflicting edits to fail visibly, so that another player's newer choice is not silently overwritten.
7. As a player, I want all players to edit an Action Slot until Weekly Confirmation, so that collaboration does not require slot ownership or individual confirmations.
8. As a player, I want each Staged Action Choice to keep its team, rolls, targets, costs, and details together, so that moving it does not change its meaning.
9. As a player, I want to stage, replace, clear, move, and swap complete choices with cards, so that arranging Activity is quick at the table.
10. As a player, I want incomplete choices to remain visible while I fill them in, so that I can prepare the week incrementally.
11. As a player, I want occupied slots to remain visible when the action allowance shrinks, so that no staged work disappears.
12. As a player, I want to resolve an over-allowance choice by moving or clearing it, or recording a reasoned Rules Exception, so that the table can adjudicate intentional departures.
13. As a player, I want invalid numeric entry to leave my existing input intact and clearing to remove the value explicitly, so that zero and missing input remain distinct.
14. As a player, I want calculated rules defaults and modifier explanations, so that I supply dice and table decisions without re-entering deterministic arithmetic.
15. As a player, I want warnings to explain rule mismatches and structural errors to identify invalid data, so that I understand what needs correction.
16. As a player, I want a shared Rules Exception with a required reason to permit an unusual choice, so that intentional exceptions remain visible in later sessions.
17. As a player, I want a Table Adjustment with a required reason to change a calculated result after the Rules Baseline, so that adjudication is distinguishable from normal calculation.
18. As a player, I want readiness to identify every required roll, target, selection, and acknowledgement, so that an incomplete week cannot be accidentally confirmed.
19. As a player, I want the Resolution Preview to include every resulting militia, roster, officer, settlement, asset, event, and future-week change, so that Confirmation contains no hidden outcomes.
20. As a player, I want earlier-phase edits to recompute later outcomes, so that action eligibility and Event consequences reflect the week we are actually preparing.
21. As a player, I want first-use Upkeep behavior and ordered losses, rank increases, and treasury changes to follow the rules, so that mid-campaign week numbering does not change the result.
22. As a player, I want officer, manager, team-condition, settlement, and one-use modifiers applied exactly once, so that bonuses and restrictions remain trustworthy.
23. As a player, I want separate teams of the same type and multiple officer holders to retain their identities, so that rules refer to the intended people and teams.
24. As a player, I want every action and event to support its required targets, rolls, calculated outcomes, and recorded narrative decisions, so that manual adjudication does not silently omit an effect.
25. As a player, I want Roll Twice, duplicate events, automatic events, and replacement rolls handled independently and in order, so that all applicable outcomes are resolved.
26. As a player, I want carried persistent events processed with stable age, order, and targets, so that recurring effects remain consistent across weeks.
27. As a player, I want Persistent Phase availability fixed by the events carried into the week, so that resolving or creating an event does not unexpectedly change navigation.
28. As a player, I want to stage persistent mitigation, ending, and buyoff decisions with their costs and timing, so that they are included in the reviewed week.
29. As a player, I want order delivery shown in days and receipt recorded explicitly, so that expedited delivery has its intended value and cannot be received twice.
30. As a player, I want Confirmation to wait for my earlier edits and reject a changed reviewed source, so that I never commit an unseen result.
31. As a player, I want competing Confirmations to produce one committed week and one successor draft, so that a week cannot advance twice.
32. As a player, I want delayed edits from a finished week to fail, so that they cannot alter the next week.
33. As a player, I want a warning before leaving with pending edits, so that I can avoid losing work that has not been accepted.
34. As a player, I want finished weeks displayed from immutable Resolution Records, so that today's militia state cannot change what history shows.
35. As a player, I want a new or mid-campaign militia to enter the same draft lifecycle, so that setup does not create a separate gameplay path.
36. As a GM, I want correction controls restricted to the GM while normal preparation and Confirmation remain shared, so that table authority is preserved.
37. As a maintainer, I want behavior accessible through a small Workspace interface and shared rules implementation, so that a rules or draft change has locality.
38. As a maintainer, I want tests to assert observable outcomes through module interfaces, so that refactoring private implementation does not require rewriting unrelated tests.
39. As a maintainer, I want every testable rules behavior linked to executable coverage, so that a passing suite cannot conceal an omitted action or event.
40. As a campaign operator, I want a rehearsed, restartable cutover that preserves current state and intentionally resets unfinished choices and old history, so that migration has a verifiable result.
41. As a campaign operator, I want legacy writes rejected and old tabs required to reload, so that queued requests cannot corrupt the new draft model.
42. As a campaign operator, I want a verified backup and recovery procedure before reopening editing, so that a failed cutover can be reversed without losing newly accepted player work.

**Implementation Decisions**

**Authority and decision precedence**

The accepted resolutions linked from #33 are normative, including all three parts of the 95-entry audit in #54. Later explicit resolutions take precedence over earlier tentative wording:

- #36 supersedes the old product-description requirement for first-claim locking, timeouts, release transitions, and per-slot confirmation. Slots are empty or staged and jointly editable until Weekly Confirmation. This conflict with older repository guidance must remain explicit during implementation.
- #56 and #55 supersede #34's description of treasury transactions, rank-up, and persistent buyoff as immediate adjacent operations. Their weekly effects must be staged, previewed, and committed through Confirmation. Historical navigation remains a separate read-only operation.
- #56 permits an over-capacity choice through a reasoned Rules Exception; #36's unready-until-move-or-clear wording does not remove that later exception path.
- Written militia rules are the baseline except for named accepted interpretations. Existing tests and current behavior do not authorize preserving a demonstrated defect.

**Module ownership and seams**

| Module or adapter | Interface and ownership |
| --- | --- |
| Weekly Draft Workspace | One external feature seam, exposed through `useWeeklyDraftWorkspace`. Discriminated `unavailable`, `loading`, `failed`, and `ready` states; only ready exposes the current discriminated Phase View and `edit`, `viewPhase`, and `confirm` operation families. Owns orchestration, local Phase View selection, projection composition, and translation of semantic operations. |
| Weekly Draft contract | Shared canonical validators, inferred types, defaults, and semantic edit validation. Convex storage and argument validators derive from this contract. |
| Action Slot | Internal pure module owning complete action-discriminated choices and atomic choice operations. Does not introduce a second UI seam. |
| Weekly Draft Rules Projection | Shared pure projection from a Weekly Draft Revision and militia snapshot to phase facts, eligibility, readiness, warnings, action requirements, resolved events, and Resolution Preview. Owns all pre-Confirmation militia calculation. |
| Weekly Draft Persistence | Internal seam with production Convex and deterministic in-memory adapters. Owns ordering, acknowledgements, target-aware concurrency, retries, draft identity isolation, and the Confirmation barrier. |
| Weekly Resolution | Existing adjacent deterministic module, extended only where its interface must consume canonical source and produce the complete change plan. Confirmation applies that plan atomically. |
| Browser interaction and input adapters | Own editable text, pointer/hover/drag state, DOM references, animation, formatting, and conversion to semantic edits. |
| Board shell and phase presentation | Thin composition and rendering. Phase Views contain facts and affordances; presentation owns copy, styling, grouping, card order, and static explanations. History navigation composes beside Workspace. |

Depth comes from hiding orchestration and persistence behind the small Workspace interface. Its deletion would redistribute that complexity to the board and phase callers. Avoid pass-through modules that recreate the current field-by-field controller interface. UI and Workspace behavior tests must not depend on raw synchronized drafts, query composition, setters, flushing, retries, DOM references, or private projection structures.

**Canonical Weekly Draft and input contract**

- Store one typed revisioned envelope with stable Weekly Draft identity, revision, week number, immutable week-start context, and domain inputs grouped by Upkeep, Activity, Event, and Table Adjustments. Include the typed persistent-event decisions needed by projection without creating a competing draft representation.
- Fixed context includes Persistent Phase Eligibility, determined once from unresolved events carried into the week. Current-week event creation or resolution does not change it. Retain first-use context independently of the displayed week number.
- Canonical values are typed or explicitly absent. Phase selection, readiness, warnings, Resolution Preview, browser text, transport state, and Convex document identifiers are not canonical editable domain inputs.
- Semantic edits are discriminated domain operations, including explicit clears. Do not accept generic partial objects, string paths, form events, or raw text at the Workspace seam.
- Numeric roll/count entry accepts only blank or ASCII digits. Reject invalid typing/paste without changing the field; reject signs, decimal points, exponent notation, and whitespace. Blank emits a clear; accepted digits become a structurally valid non-negative integer. Rules ranges are advisory. Monetary entry uses explicit units that preserve copper precision. Signed Table Adjustments use their own typed validation.
- Browser forms use React Hook Form and Zod with styled field-level errors that distinguish required input from invalid format. Error expansion must not misalign adjacent controls. Canonical domain validators remain the single shared shape; browser schemas validate entry, not a separately maintained persistence model.
- Retain raw dice and modifier provenance, stable action-choice and event-occurrence identities, independent event trees and replacement rolls, per-instance persistent targets and mitigation, narrative acknowledgements, Rules Exceptions, Table Adjustments, operating settlement and consumable bonuses, and order due-day/receipt facts.

**Action Slots and collaboration**

- Activity owns an ordered collection of slots with stable identities independent of display position. A slot owns zero or one complete action-discriminated Staged Action Choice, including assigned team and every action-dependent input. Partial choices are valid draft state.
- Replacing an action removes incompatible prior details. A detail edit verifies that the same staged choice still occupies the target; replacing it with another choice of the same action type must not make an obsolete detail edit safe.
- Deck-to-empty stages; deck-to-occupied replaces; slot-to-empty moves; slot-to-occupied swaps; slot-to-outside clears. Each operation moves or changes complete choices atomically.
- Retain occupied extra slots when capacity shrinks. Warn and require correction or a reasoned Rules Exception before Confirmation. Never truncate staged choices to fit capacity.
- Structural invariants belong to Action Slot. Cross-slot rules such as team use, Lie Low exclusivity, Drill uniqueness, and capacity belong to Rules Projection.
- There are no claims, claimant identities, ownership locks, timeouts, release lifecycle, or persisted per-slot confirmed states. Card interactions stage work; the whole week has the explicit Confirmation action.

**Persistence and Confirmation contract**

- Show semantic edits immediately as pending. `edit` resolves as accepted only after storage; otherwise it resolves failed, discards the failed edit, restores the latest server value, and presents the standard save-failed feedback. Do not expose a separate conflict result.
- Each operation carries a stable draft identity, client operation identity, and base revision. A stale edit can be accepted only when none of its targets changed since that base. Any changed target rejects the entire edit.
- A normal field is one target. Choice replacement, clear, move, and swap target every affected slot. Detail edits target the detail and verify unchanged choice identity. Validate referenced entities and campaign ownership server-side.
- Process each Workspace's submissions in order; later edits cannot finish before earlier edits. Every accepted semantic edit creates exactly one revision. Batching must have the same visible result as ordered individual processing.
- Retry temporary transport failures internally with the same operation identity. Deduplicate accepted retries. Do not automatically retry server rejections. Older responses must never replace newer visible revisions.
- Keep pending edits only for the open page and warn on page exit. Phase navigation neither waits for, cancels, nor flushes edits.
- Confirmation waits for earlier local edits, pauses new local edits, and uses exactly the accepted source the player reviewed. Never substitute the newest or just-flushed revision silently. Relevant militia-snapshot changes outside the draft must also invalidate the reviewed source.
- A pending browser forecast cannot confirm. After acceptance, the matching Convex preview replaces it. Both previews are forecasts; the transactional Weekly Resolution is authoritative.
- Confirmation returns accepted or failed. A stale source, incomplete required input, invalid reference, or failed write rejects the entire transaction. On failure, keep the draft open, load current state, and require review and another explicit attempt.
- Success atomically applies the complete change plan, records the full confirmed source and outcome, closes the old identity, and creates exactly one empty successor with fresh identity and fixed week context. Delayed edits tied to the old draft fail; simultaneous Confirmations cannot advance twice.

**Rules Baseline, exceptions, and complete outcomes**

Compute rules in weekly order: Upkeep, ordered Activity choices, Event, and applicable persistent/successor processing. Read carried persistent facts wherever earlier calculations need them. Local Phase View navigation does not change resolution order.

The complete Rules Baseline precedes ordered typed Table Adjustments. Any player can record a Rules Exception with a required reason to permit a rule-disallowed choice; it does not change arithmetic. Missing required inputs and malformed data still block Confirmation. Distinguish optional mitigation not attempted from an attempted but incomplete mitigation.

Cover all 24 actions, 24 event-table outcomes, four team trees, advancement/reputation/cache tables, officer and manager mechanics, team conditions and recovery/loss, boons, first-use behavior, queued effects, persistent events, and compound interactions. Deterministic values are computed automatically. Dice and narrative adjudication are supplied and recorded; showing explanatory text alone does not execute an outcome. Record reward, boon, encounter, and support acknowledgement with the prescribed quantities and conditions without building tactical or character-builder execution.

The preview and authoritative plan include every militia, team, officer, settlement, cache, marketplace, order, tracked-person, event, queue, and acknowledgement effect. Transaction write loops validate authority and apply the plan; they must not derive additional hidden outcomes. No stale input may grant a benefit for an action no longer staged.

Apply all nine policies accepted in #56:

1. Correct every unaccepted baseline defect. Rank 1 has one baseline action; failed Dismiss Team still removes its target and applies rolled Notoriety. Manual outcomes and missing models remain required work.
2. Calculate deterministic defaults, compose modifiers exactly once, retain raw dice and natural-roll provenance, and record explicit narrative adjudication.
3. Keep reasoned shared Rules Exceptions distinct from reasoned Table Adjustments, retaining both in confirmed source/history.
4. An eligible uneventful week supplies one current-rank modifier to the following week's event chance, not its percentile roll; do not accumulate bonuses across quiet weeks. Preserve first-use and event-specific exclusions, account for automatic events, and bound chance to 10–95%.
5. Resolve duplicate events without a Twice clause independently. Apply actual Twice replacement/enhancement clauses and explicit no-additional-effect clauses. Repeated Roll Twice requires replacement rolls rather than disappearing results.
6. Persistent Double Agent blocks Secure Cache during each affected Activity until ending and applies one −2 Secrecy penalty. Do not add a second queued penalty. A nonpersistent occurrence affects the next Activity only; intentional exceptions remain possible.
7. First persistent buyoff is available immediately. Later buyoffs share one militia-wide four-week cooldown: a week-2 buyoff permits the next in week 6. Cost is twice current minimum treasury; preview the staged cost/end and apply warning/exception policy to insufficient funds.
8. Preserve Special Order duration in days, including one-day expedited delivery and its surcharge, enchantment timing, and explicit receipt with no duplicate receipt. Broker Market retains its separate next-Activity timing.
9. Floor whole counts without invented minima and preserve money to copper precision. Rank-1 Strike Team supplies zero baseline support rounds; odd-level rescue Notoriety and split XP round down.

The audit's full inventory remains required, not just its headline defects. Mandatory examples include first-week skip independent of week number; post-loss multi-rank progression; ordered costs before Theft; no gain without its action; complete readiness; exact-once modifiers; High Morale, Found Fire, and Calm before the Storm duplicates; recurring Rivalry targets and ending; and all queued-effect duration, check, and loss branches.

**Campaign models and history lifecycle**

- Give individual teams stable identities, allowing repeated team types and reward-team cap exemptions. Support multiple officer holders, non-stacking rules except Commandants, distinct Commandant Hit Dice, manager limits, ordered officer changes, and occurrence-specific Strategist bonuses.
- Preserve settlement context, per-event targets and stable age/order, temporary mitigation versus permanent ending, buyoff bookkeeping, one-use bonuses, carry, and precise delivery/receipt state. Extend affected ledger and onboarding interfaces with their required facts.
- New and mid-campaign setup create the same canonical draft lifecycle. Rule deviations in structurally valid existing state remain advisory.
- Exactly one open Weekly Draft exists per militia. A closed draft survives as the complete source of its immutable Resolution Record, not another editable historical draft.
- Store source, Ruleset Version, baseline/final change plans, warnings, Rules Exceptions, Table Adjustments, and final outcome. Increment Ruleset Version when resolution behavior changes, not for presentation or implementation-only changes.
- Historical Week Views read effective immutable records and their recorded source/context, never today's militia snapshot or legacy rollback snapshots. Select the newest unsuperseded record; retain older records as audit history and never merge them.
- Reserve supersession links and the separate History Rewrite seam for future Historical Reconstruction and Historical Correction. Those operations must not reopen a Weekly Draft. The established future contract is one shared rewrite per campaign, ordered recalculation stopping at the first conflict, and atomic publication only after the complete rewrite is valid and explicitly confirmed. Building that editor is outside this implementation.
- Preserve campaign/organization access controls, shared player preparation and Confirmation, and the GM-only correction authority seam. Keep GM controls hidden from non-GM players and enforce authority in the backend.

**Ordered extraction and migration checkpoints**

Follow the accepted sequence in #55. Each extraction keeps the supported application usable, preserves established coverage, and adds outcome coverage for the moved behavior. Move each calculation once. When legacy inputs represent the facts faithfully, browser and server consumers switch to the shared calculation together. When necessary facts are absent, build and test the canonical path in isolation until cutover; do not fabricate raw rolls, collapse occurrences, or discard reasons to fit legacy storage.

1. **Establish verification.** Verify generated Convex artifacts and restore/read the generated AI guidelines before backend implementation. Establish a passing typecheck, lint, and collected-test baseline. Create the machine-readable rules catalog from all 95 audit entries, expanding compound cases and recording gaps. Establish isolated Convex test persistence, transport controls, authenticated browser contexts, and CI gates before extraction depends on them. Missing, skipped, todo, or failed tests do not count as passing coverage.
2. **Introduce canonical contract and Action Slot.** Implement validators, defaults, immutable context, semantic edits, stable identities, partial choices, explicit absence, atomic complete-choice operations, and the additional raw-roll/event/adjudication facts. Prove structural validation, zero versus missing, stale-detail removal, whole-choice movement, and retained extra slots. No live storage changes at this stage.
3. **Prepare additive storage and campaign prerequisites.** Add canonical draft and immutable-record storage beside legacy storage, including deduplication, conflict metadata, and one-open-draft enforcement. Prepare richer teams, officers, events, settlement context, money, and delivery models and their ledger/setup support. Prepare restartable mapping while preserving the usable old release; keep new endpoints unavailable to live campaigns. Existing teams receive stable identities and existing officer holders become singleton collections. Unrecoverable Hit Dice, event targets/order, delivery context, and week-start facts require explicit preflight resolution. Mapping must not guess them or recalculate live balances.
4. **Extract Rules Projection.** Move foundations first, then Upkeep, Activity, Event, and persistent/successor behavior. After each slice require corrected named outcomes, important edge cases, dependent-phase recomputation, and browser/Convex parity. Temporary old exported helpers may translate shapes and delegate only. Do not activate a corrected capacity calculation through a legacy save path that truncates occupied slots.
5. **Complete preview and change plan.** Extend Weekly Resolution only as required. Stage treasury/rank/buyoff effects; account for every authoritative effect; distinguish incomplete required input from unattempted optional mitigation; invalidate previews for all outcome-affecting source changes. Require full preview-to-committed-state-diff equality and retained adjudication source.
6. **Implement Persistence adapters and lifecycle.** Build both adapters against the same contract, including target-aware stale edits, deduplication, ordering, monotonic observations, draft isolation, exact Confirmation, immutable records, and successor creation. Verify production persistence on an isolated deployment and transactional access/race/rollback cases with Convex integration tests. Wrapping the existing last-write-wins save endpoint is insufficient.
7. **Replace Workspace orchestration and phase builders.** Move controller, mutation orchestration, and synchronization responsibilities behind Workspace. Convert Upkeep, Activity, Event, Persistent, and Summary in that order. A temporary canonical-Phase-View-to-existing-props adapter may preserve presentation; remove it when its caller migrates. Keep input/browser mechanics in adapters and leave a thin board shell. Replace coupled tests only after their meaningful behaviors pass at the new interface or an accepted decision supersedes them. Exercise the canonical path in isolation before cutover.
8. **Pass completeness and rehearsal gates.** Require human-reviewed complete corpus coverage, passing mapped tests, current source fingerprints, no unexplained gaps, and projection parity. Rehearse the entire write pause, verified backup, restartable preservation/reset, reader/writer switch, legacy rejection, reload, and pre-reopen recovery on isolated data. Verify one fresh draft, empty choices/new history, retained state/context/carry, and no initialization-triggered Upkeep, queued effects, or week advancement.
9. **Perform paused cutover and retire legacy.** At the later operational cutover, reject all affected campaign writes server-side, including legacy save/confirm/rollback and adjacent writes; take and verify a restorable backup while paused; initialize and verify canonical state; switch readers/writers together; require reload; reopen only after acceptance. Keep old endpoints rejected afterward. Retire temporary adapters, duplicate calculations, old controllers/builders, legacy rows, and obsolete schema fields after acceptance; retain the backup through the verification window.

Map every audit entry to these checkpoints and expanded executable cases. Foundations/officers/teams span stages 2–4; Upkeep/actions span 4–5; Event cases span 4–5; persistence/product contracts span 2–9. Full coverage is a cutover prerequisite, not an assertion made while the initial catalog still contains known gaps.

**Preservation, reset, and recovery contract**

Preserve authoritative current militia values, current week number, characters, officer assignments, teams/conditions, settlement reputation, assets, active/persistent events, first-use metadata, uneventful carry, queued effects, persistent age/order, and buyoff bookkeeping. Retain recoverable week-start context even when it currently lives in legacy week storage.

The approved migration intentionally resets unfinished current-week choices and excludes legacy Resolution Records and embedded rollback history from the new active model. Start history with the first new Confirmation. Retain original storage temporarily for rollback. Initialize exactly one empty draft per militia at an initial revision with fresh stable identities, initial conflict metadata, and empty operation deduplication. Restarting initialization must not duplicate entities, drafts, or carry.

Initialization must not execute Upkeep or Weekly Resolution, apply queues, advance the week, reverse already-applied changes, or retrospectively correct existing balances. Resolve missing required context during preflight before reopening. Verify preserved values/references against backup; exercise editing and Confirmation only in isolated rehearsal, not by advancing a production campaign as a test.

Before reopening, a failed cutover recovers with the compatible old release and retained data or verified backup while writes remain paused. Reopening ends automatic rollback: newly accepted work must be preserved or its loss separately agreed. No online migration, dual writes, unfinished-choice converter, legacy-history reconstruction, or reverse converter is required.

**Testing Decisions**

Good tests assert externally observable behavior through the highest useful module interface. Prefer the Workspace seam for integrated edit/readiness/Phase View behavior, the existing Weekly Resolution interface for outcome/change-plan assertions, and the real Persistence seam where two adapters actually vary. Private setters, effect schedules, merge-object shapes, batching calls, and hook wiring are not contracts.

- **Rules Projection and Weekly Resolution:** Cover named rules outcomes and compound edge cases through the pure interfaces. Check full baseline, adjusted result, required inputs, and complete committed state differences. Reuse meaningful week-advancement, progression, officer/manager, and Weekly Resolution test scenarios after reviewing their expectations against the accepted rules policies.
- **Rules catalog:** Maintain one machine-readable test artifact with stable rule IDs, source references/fingerprints, expected Phase View or Resolution Preview behavior, important cases, and stable named test IDs; generate a readable report. Validate against collected results. Fail for missing mappings, stale sources, missing/failed/skipped/todo referenced tests, or browser/Convex divergence. Source links and fingerprints prove traceability; human review of the full corpus establishes completeness. All 95 audit entries are starting inventory, not a ceiling.
- **Workspace:** Assert readiness states, semantic edit outcomes, local Phase Views, immediate pending feedback, recovery to accepted state, explicit clearing, navigation during pending work, page-exit warning, and reviewed-source Confirmation. Assert fixed Persistent Phase Eligibility when events end or appear midweek.
- **Shared Persistence contracts:** Define scenarios once and run against both adapter factories. The Convex adapter must exercise actual isolated Convex persistence; mocked successful mutation returns are insufficient. Control transport timing without replacing transaction behavior. Cover disjoint stale edits; same-target failure; atomic multi-slot moves/swaps; obsolete detail edits after replacement; one revision per accepted edit; dropped responses and idempotent retry; ordered acknowledgement; monotonic delivery; and closed-draft rejection.
- **Transactional integration:** Retain and adapt the existing Convex history integration foundation. Cover actual authorization, cross-campaign references, GM-only correction authority, mapping, stale source rejection including external militia changes, edit/Confirmation races, simultaneous Confirmations, all-or-nothing failure, immutable records, effective history selection, and exactly one successor. Keep the full rules permutation suite in pure tests.
- **UI:** Preserve formatting and card interaction tests, explicit clear/zero behavior, styled validation, feedback, and browser mechanics. Use existing design-system controls and accessible production interactions. Rule calculations move out of presentation tests with the calculations themselves.
- **Replace coupled tests:** Rewrite controller/mutation/synchronization tests around Workspace and Persistence outcomes. Incrementally replace the hand-built mutation database harness with pure outcome tests or transactional integration; mocked authorization and a hand-built database do not prove access control or rollback. Delete a scenario only when its replacement passes or a linked accepted decision changes the expected behavior. Legacy rollback mechanics are not requirements to retain.
- **Two-player browser gate:** Require separate authenticated browser contexts against isolated Convex persistence before extraction merges. Prove shared edits, independent Phase Views, same-target failure and visible recovery as the new contract lands, Confirmation races, and delayed edits after advancement. Assert eventual agreement, one history outcome, and one successor through domain-state observations rather than arbitrary sleeps or internal calls. Add runner setup, test identities, deployment cleanup, and CI wiring before relying on this gate.
- **Rehearsal:** Assert the full preservation/reset/restart/rejection/reload/recovery contract, including no rule execution during initialization. Production campaigns are not test fixtures.

Every feature extraction runs `pnpm -s typecheck`, `pnpm -s lint`, relevant tests, and the required browser gate for the supported path. Establish new contract scenarios as their implementations land. Full reviewed rules coverage, real adapter verification, multiplayer evidence, and successful cutover rehearsal are mandatory before reopening the migrated application.

**Out of Scope**

- Performing implementation, deployment, or production migration merely by publishing this specification.
- Visual redesign of the week board; retain the tablet-landscape, multi-device card workflow and usable desktop/phone layouts.
- New militia rules or modifications to the campaign rules corpus.
- A full character builder, tactical combat simulator, or automatic execution of GM narrative adjudication.
- Reworking Weekly Resolution internals beyond the interface and completeness needed by this architecture.
- Detailed History Rewrite editing/conflict-resolution UX or reopening old Weekly Drafts. Required record/lifecycle seams remain in scope.
- Prescribing detailed exception and receipt presentation beyond the required shared data, semantic operations, feedback, and outcomes.
- Claim ownership, per-slot confirmation, offline/reload-safe pending edits, dual authority, online migration, and preservation/conversion of discarded unfinished choices or legacy history.

**Further Notes**

This specification is the implementation handoff from the closed planning map, not evidence that its acceptance criteria already pass. Local inspection still finds the existing controller/phase-builder architecture and adjacent Weekly Resolution module. Generated Convex runtime/type artifacts exist, but the generated AI guidelines are absent in this checkout; verification setup must address that before backend implementation. No application tests were run during this synthesis.

Use the repository's domain glossary and militia rules/tables throughout implementation. No relevant ADR directory was present during inspection. Existing local edits to agent guidance and the domain glossary are outside this publishing task.

### Accepted verification contract (#53)

Part of [Untangle the Weekly Draft board architecture](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/33).

**Question**

What test architecture should protect the Weekly Draft refactor while old modules are replaced?

[Which module owns rules-derived phase projections?](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/37) already requires full militia-rules coverage, a CI-enforced rules coverage catalog, Phase View outcome tests, Resolution Preview and Weekly Resolution tests, focused Convex adapter tests, and presentation-only UI tests. Treat those requirements as fixed.

Decide the catalog's code location and check format; the shared contract suite for the production Convex and in-memory persistence adapters; which current controller, hook, mutation-harness, and integration tests should be removed or retained; and the migration compatibility and multi-player end-to-end cases that must survive every extraction step.


**Resolution**

The user confirmed the recommendations in both discussion rounds. Protect the refactor with tests through the agreed module interfaces, a machine-readable rules coverage catalog, and a required two-player browser suite.

**Rules coverage catalog and CI**

Put the canonical catalog at `tests/rules/coverage-catalog.ts` and generate a readable report from it. Each entry carries a stable rule ID, a source reference into `militia-rules.md` or `militia-tables.md`, the expected Phase View or Resolution Preview behavior, important edge cases, and stable IDs of named behavior tests.

CI checks the catalog against collected test results: referenced tests must exist and pass; skipped, todo, missing, or failed tests never establish coverage. Check source fingerprints so a changed rules section requires catalog review. Fail for missing rule mappings, stale source references, or browser/Convex projection differences. A fingerprint or test link establishes traceability, not semantic completeness: review against the full corpus establishes that every testable rule and its important cases have been identified.

During extraction, track known coverage gaps explicitly and require each step to preserve established coverage and cover the behavior it moves. Do not conceal gaps with skipped tests or claim an incomplete catalog is complete. Full reviewed rules coverage is a cutover prerequisite, as required by [Which module owns rules-derived phase projections?](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/37). The existing audit and product-exception decisions determine the rule inventory and any authorized departures; this ticket does not resolve those decisions.

**Test surfaces and shared adapter contract**

- Shared pure Rules Projection tests exercise rule outcomes and edge cases. Run representative domain fixtures through browser and Convex entry paths to detect mapping or projection divergence.
- Weekly Draft Workspace tests exercise semantic edits, Phase Views, readiness, pending/accepted/failed outcomes, and Confirmation through the external interface. They do not assert hook wiring or internal object-merging algorithms.
- Weekly Resolution tests retain Resolution Preview and authoritative change-plan assertions.
- Focused Convex integration tests cover document/domain mapping, authorization, accepted revisions, atomic writes, and the draft/history lifecycle rather than duplicating the full rule suite.
- UI tests cover formatting, explicit clearing, interaction, feedback, and presentation. Rule calculations belong in projection tests.

Define the persistence contract scenarios once and run them against factories for both the deterministic in-memory adapter and the production Convex adapter. The production adapter must exercise actual Convex persistence; mocking a successful mutation return is insufficient. Use an isolated test deployment for deployed adapter verification. Control delays, failures, retries, and delivery order through the test harness at the transport seam, without replacing server transaction behavior. Keep `convex-test` for focused transactional integration.

The common scenarios include disjoint stale edits accepted, same-target edits rejected, atomic multi-slot edits, action-detail edits rejected after action replacement, one revision per accepted semantic edit, idempotent retries, submission-order acknowledgement, monotonic responses, and rejection of delayed edits for closed drafts. Workspace scenarios additionally protect immediate local Phase View navigation while edits are pending, page-exit warnings, failure feedback, Confirmation waiting for earlier edits and pausing new local edits, exact reviewed-revision rejection, and edit-versus-Confirmation and simultaneous-Confirmation races. Browser mechanics are exercised through the Workspace/browser surface with each persistence adapter where applicable.

**Existing tests: retain behavior, replace implementation coupling**

- Retain and expand `src/lib/week-advancement.test.ts` and relevant Weekly Resolution outcome tests. Assess their expected outcomes against the written rules and recorded product exceptions rather than preserving an existing defect.
- Retain and expand `convex/weekBoard.history.integration.test.ts` as a transactional integration foundation. Preserve meaningful authorization, preview/outcome, stale Confirmation, concurrent Confirmation, immutable-history, and atomic-failure cases. Adapt fixtures and assertions to the new lifecycle; legacy rollback mechanics are not a requirement to preserve.
- Replace `src/lib/week-board-mutation-harness.test.ts` incrementally. Its hand-built database and mocked authorization do not prove transaction rollback or access control. Move rule cases to pure module-interface tests and persistence cases to adapter contracts or Convex integration.
- Rewrite `use-week-board-controller.test.tsx`, `use-week-board-mutations.test.tsx`, and `week-board-controller-sync.test.ts` around Workspace and persistence outcomes. Preserve local navigation, explicit clears, pending-edit protection, ordering, acknowledgement, and draft isolation. Exact autosave calls, batching schedules, flush methods, and helper object shapes are internal details; preserve only their effects required by the accepted contract.
- Keep presentation and interaction tests at the UI surface. Move calculation assertions to the Rules Projection when those calculations move.

Delete an old test only once its meaningful scenario passes at its replacement interface, or a linked decision explicitly supersedes the old behavior. This avoids both lost coverage and a permanent duplicate suite around retired modules.

**Required two-player browser gate**

Before merging extraction changes, require a small two-player browser suite against an isolated Convex deployment. Use separate authenticated browser contexts and verify shared edits, independent Phase Views, conflicting edits and visible recovery, Confirmation races, and delayed edits after week advancement. Assert eventual agreement and the resulting single successor draft/history outcome, not arbitrary sleeps or internal calls.

Detailed failure permutations remain in the controlled contract suite. The browser suite proves real subscription delivery and user interaction. Runner setup, isolated deployment setup/cleanup, test identities, and CI wiring are required implementation prerequisites: the inspected repository currently has Vitest and `convex-test`, but no browser runner or `.github` workflow directory.

**Extraction and cutover gates**

Every extraction preserves the established behavioral and multiplayer gates and adds coverage for its moved behavior. The extraction-order decision must place the required test infrastructure before steps that rely on it.

Cutover rehearsal must verify the preservation and reset contract from [How can the Weekly Draft contract migrate live campaign data safely?](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/52): preserved authoritative campaign state and week context/carry metadata; exactly one fresh draft; empty unfinished choices and new history; restartable initialization without duplicate drafts or effects; no unintended Upkeep, queued-effect application, or week advancement; server-side rejection of legacy writes; and recovery to the old implementation/data before editing reopens. Exercise new edits and Confirmation in isolation, not against production campaign state as a test.

No old-client compatibility conversion or history reconstruction suite is required by the paused-cutover decision. After reopening, restoring an old backup is not automatic rollback.

**Scope**

This records a planning decision only. No test infrastructure, application code, deployment, or production data was changed. The remaining audit, product-exception, and extraction-order questions already have tickets; no new fog or decision ticket was exposed.

### Accepted implementation and cutover sequence (#55)

Part of #33.

**Question**

What exact migration order safely replaces the current Weekly Draft controller, storage shape, duplicated rules, and phase builders with the decided Weekly Draft Workspace, canonical Weekly Draft Revision, Action Slot aggregate, Weekly Draft Persistence adapters, and Weekly Draft Rules Projection?

Name each extraction step, temporary adapter, compatibility point, data migration or backfill, and test checkpoint. Keep the app usable and the test suite green after every step. Avoid running old and new rule implementations as competing sources of truth. Include the full militia-rules coverage gate and every bug or product exception decided earlier in this map.

Planning only: do not implement the refactor in this ticket.


**Resolution: Weekly Draft migration sequence**

Planning only. The driving developer accepted correcting rules alongside each extraction, with representation-dependent behavior activated only once its storage and inputs are ready. The driving developer also confirmed the complete nine-step sequence in the live Wayfinder discussion (“Yes”). This is the accepted planning resolution.

**Fixed decisions and activation discipline**

Use the Workspace, canonical Revision, Action Slot, Persistence, Rules Projection, lifecycle, paused-cutover, test-architecture, audit, and exception decisions indexed in [Untangle the Weekly Draft board architecture](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/33). This sequence does not reopen them.

Move each calculation once. Where the old input shape represents the required facts unambiguously, both old browser and server consumers delegate to the extracted implementation in the same change, and corrected outcome tests replace wrong expectations. Where required facts are absent, implement and test the canonical path without activating it for live campaigns until cutover. Do not synthesize raw dice from entered totals, collapse independent occurrences, or discard reasons to fit legacy storage.

The old application remains usable while the canonical path is assembled in isolation. For an activated rule there is one implementation; old and new projections must never compete to produce a live result. The retained old release/data is a rollback artifact, not a second runtime authority. No dual writes, old-client compatibility converter, unfinished-choice conversion, or history reconstruction is required.

**Ordered extraction and checkpoints**

**1. Establish executable verification before extraction**

Restore the generated Convex files, including the required `convex/_generated/ai/guidelines.md`, and read those guidelines before backend implementation. Establish a passing typecheck, lint, and collected-test baseline; the audit's missing-import suite failures and pending tests are not passing coverage.

Create `tests/rules/coverage-catalog.ts` from all 95 audit entries, expanding compound entries into individual rule/case mappings. Record source references/fingerprints, expected behavior, test IDs, and explicit remaining gaps. Wire collected-result validation and a readable report. Establish isolated Convex deployment setup/cleanup, test identities, transport controls, and two authenticated browser contexts before extraction merges rely on them.

Checkpoint: the existing supported behavior runs; every subsequent extraction passes `pnpm -s typecheck`, `pnpm -s lint`, relevant tests, and the required two-player suite for the supported path. New contract scenarios become mandatory as their implementations land. Known coverage gaps remain visible; no skipped/todo/missing test establishes coverage, and no global full-coverage claim is made early.

**2. Introduce the canonical contract and pure Action Slot module**

Define shared validators, inferred types, defaults, immutable week context, explicit absence, and domain-specific `WeeklyDraftEdit` variants. Add stable draft, slot, action-choice, event-occurrence, and referenced-entity identity where needed. Activity is an ordered collection of slots owning complete action-discriminated choices, including assigned team, details, rolls, and costs.

Implement stage/replace, detail edit, clear, move, and swap as pure semantic operations. Retain occupied slots when capacity shrinks; projection supplies the warning/exception/readiness result. There are no claims, ownership locks, timeouts, or per-slot confirmations. The later Rules Exception decision permits an otherwise out-of-rules extra choice when its required reason is recorded.

Add canonical facts needed by the audit: raw rolls and modifier provenance; independent event trees and replacement rolls; per-instance persistent targets, mitigation and ending; narrative acknowledgements; Rules Exceptions and typed Table Adjustments; due-day and receipt data; operating settlement and one-use bonuses. Keep temporary input text outside the contract. Use the agreed digits-or-blank grammar for count/roll entry, explicit clears, and explicit units for monetary inputs so copper precision survives; signed Table Adjustments retain their own validation.

Checkpoint: structural validation, partial choices, explicit zero versus missing, action replacement clearing stale details, complete-choice atomic movement, stable identity, and retained over-capacity choices pass through the pure interface. No live storage changes yet.

**3. Prepare additive storage and campaign-state prerequisites**

Add dedicated canonical draft and immutable Resolution Record storage beside legacy storage, with schema deriving from shared validators. Prepare draft identity/revision, operation deduplication, target-conflict metadata, one-open-draft enforcement, complete source records, and effective-record selection. New endpoints remain inaccessible to live campaigns until activation.

Prepare richer campaign state needed for rules: independent team identities and reward exemptions; multiple officer holders and distinct Commandant Hit Dice; retained settlement context; persistent-event identity, age/order, targets and buyoff bookkeeping; carry and consumable effects; exact order timing and receipt status. Update affected ledger/onboarding interfaces alongside their model support. New campaign creation and mid-campaign setup must eventually initialize the same canonical lifecycle.

Prepare restartable cutover mapping, rather than mutating active campaigns now. Existing individual teams receive stable identities; existing officer holders become singleton collections. Preserve established values and references. Missing Hit Dice, event targets/order, delivery context, or week-start facts require explicit preflight resolution where they cannot be recovered; do not guess them from discarded choices. Do not retrospectively recalculate live balances or execute rules during initialization. Additive schema support must keep the old release usable until cutover.

Checkpoint: mapping fixtures preserve authoritative state and references, support repeated team types/multiple officers, and round-trip monetary precision. Initializer reruns do not duplicate entities, carry, or drafts. Model-dependent behavior is still inactive for live campaigns.

**4. Extract Rules Projection in dependency order**

Use one shared pure `projectWeeklyDraft({ revision, militiaSnapshot })` interface, with focused internal implementations. Extract in this order:

1. Foundations: rank/table lookups, team definitions, identity-aware capacity, focus/check composition, officer and manager mechanics, settlement modifiers, money and whole-count rounding.
2. Upkeep: fixed first-use context; ordered attrition, Notoriety and treasury checks; post-loss multi-rank advancement and boon acknowledgements; staged treasury operations.
3. Activity: process whole choices in slot order against the projected roster/resources/officers; eligibility, all action outcomes and requirements, once-per-team/Drill and Lie Low constraints, Strategist's designated choice, recovery/recruitment/upgrade, assets and narrative records.
4. Event: bounded chance, carry, settlement result modifiers, Sabotage, independent occurrences, automatic events, nested Roll Twice replacements, duplicates/Twice clauses, and every event's outcomes and required inputs.
5. Persistent and successor effects: oldest-first stable processing, per-instance weekly mitigation/end/buyoff, queued effects and expiry, next-week context, and precise order delivery/receipt.

Read carried-event facts during earlier steps whenever they affect checks or availability; the sequence of code extraction does not change the rules' runtime order. Replace duplicated browser/Convex action requirements, event derivation, and calculation helpers as each slice activates. Existing exported helpers may temporarily delegate to the new pure implementation with shape translation only.

Checkpoint after each slice: corrected named outcomes and important edge cases pass; browser and Convex entry fixtures agree; dependent later-phase results recompute correctly. Do not activate an isolated numeric fix if it triggers legacy destructive behavior—for example rank-1 capacity cannot ship through a save path that silently slices away occupied slots.

**5. Complete the Resolution Preview and authoritative change plan**

Extend the existing Weekly Resolution interface only as needed to consume the canonical source and shared calculations. Include every militia, roster, officer, settlement, cache, order, person, event, queue, and acknowledgement effect in the preview/change plan. Move hidden calculation logic out of confirmation write loops; transaction code applies the plan and validates authority rather than independently deriving outcomes.

Compute the complete Rules Baseline first, then ordered typed Table Adjustments. Rules Exceptions permit choices without modifying arithmetic. Required missing inputs and malformed references still block Confirmation. Optional mitigation not attempted differs from an attempted incomplete mitigation. All outcome-affecting source changes must invalidate the reviewed preview, including relevant campaign edits outside the draft.

Treasury deposits/withdrawals, rank effects, and persistent buyoff participate in staged weekly outcomes under the later audit/exception/lifecycle decisions; the earlier seam ticket's adjacent-operation wording must not preserve immediate writes that bypass reviewed Confirmation. Historical navigation stays a separate read-only operation. Preserve the authority seam and GM-only correction controls without implementing the deferred History Rewrite editor.

Checkpoint: full preview-to-committed-state-diff equality; no hidden effects or double-applied totals; required-input matrices; explicit departures retained in confirmed source; incomplete drafts cannot confirm.

**6. Implement both Persistence adapters and the new lifecycle**

Implement the deterministic in-memory adapter and production Convex adapter against the same contract. Require stable draft/operation identity and base revision; target-aware stale-edit acceptance/rejection; atomic multi-slot edits; detail edits checked against the same staged choice; one revision per accepted semantic edit; idempotent retries; ordered acknowledgements and monotonic responses. Do not wrap the legacy save endpoint and claim it provides these guarantees.

Confirmation is an exact-reviewed-revision barrier. It waits for earlier local edits, pauses new local edits, rejects a changed reviewed source, and atomically applies the complete plan, records the full source/ruleset/outcome, closes the old identity and creates one empty successor with fixed context. Delayed edits cannot reach the successor. History reads effective immutable records, never today's militia snapshot or legacy rollback snapshots.

Checkpoint: run shared contract scenarios against both adapters, with the production adapter exercising actual isolated Convex persistence. Retain focused `convex-test` authorization, cross-campaign reference, race, atomic-failure, immutable-history and lifecycle cases. Test edits racing edits/Confirmation, two Confirmations, dropped responses and retries, remote source changes, and stale closed-draft requests.

**7. Replace controller orchestration and phase builders through Workspace**

Introduce `useWeeklyDraftWorkspace` with unavailable/loading/failed/ready states, discriminated Phase Views, and `edit`, `viewPhase`, `confirm`. Replace `use-week-board-controller.ts`, `use-week-board-mutations.ts`, and `week-board-controller-sync.ts` responsibilities behind it. Keep local Phase View navigation immediate during pending edits, standard failure recovery, pending acknowledgement and page-exit warnings.

Convert phase sections in Upkeep, Activity, Event, Persistent and Summary order, consuming projection facts without rule calculations. A temporary canonical-Phase-View-to-existing-props adapter may preserve presentation while each section changes. Remove that adapter as soon as its caller migrates. Keep text parsing and pointer/drag/DOM mechanics in browser adapters; drops emit complete semantic edits. `WeekBoard` becomes a thin shell, and `build-view-models.ts` no longer provides a parallel orchestration interface.

Checkpoint: Workspace outcome tests, formatting/clear/drag/feedback UI tests, and real two-player agreement with independent navigation. Replace old tests only after their meaningful scenarios pass at the replacement interface or a linked decision supersedes their expected behavior. Retain useful Weekly Resolution and history integration cases; retire the hand-built database harness incrementally. Exercise the new path in isolation until cutover.

**8. Pass completeness and paused-cutover rehearsal gates**

Require human-reviewed coverage of the complete rules and tables corpus, with all mapped test IDs present and passing, fingerprints current, no unexplained gaps, and browser/Convex parity. The audit inventory is the starting point, not the completeness ceiling. All 24 actions, 24 event-table outcomes, four team trees, tables, officers, managers, sequence, persistence and product contracts must be covered, including important compound cases.

Rehearse server-side write pause, verified restorable backup, restartable preservation/reset, reader/writer switching, legacy-request rejection, reload and pre-reopen rollback on isolated data. Verify all campaign state/current week/context/carry retained, exactly one fresh empty draft per militia, empty new history, and no Upkeep, queued-effect execution or week advancement caused by initialization. Test new editing/Confirmation in isolation, never by advancing a production campaign as a test.

**9. Perform the agreed paused cutover, then retire legacy code**

At implementation time: reject all affected campaign writes server-side, including legacy save/confirm/rollback and adjacent writes; take and verify backup while paused; initialize preserved state and canonical drafts; verify invariants and rejected old requests; switch readers/writers together; require reload; reopen only after verification. Old endpoints remain rejected after reopening.

Before reopening, recover using the compatible old release and retained old data or backup while writes remain closed. Reopening ends automatic rollback: newly accepted work must be preserved or its loss separately agreed. After acceptance, remove temporary adapters, old controllers/builders/calculations, legacy rows and obsolete schema fields; retain the backup through the agreed verification window. Do not keep dual authority for convenience.

**Mandatory bug and exception accounting**

Every one of the audit's 95 entries must map to an extraction checkpoint and its expanded executable cases. Foundations/officers/teams map to steps 2–4; U01–U06 and A01–A24 to steps 4–5; E and EV entries to steps 4–5; P01–P11 to steps 2–9. The audit's explicit defect group—F01/F04, U01/U04/U06, T03/T05/T06, A06/A07/A19/A22, E03/E04/E06/E07, EV03/EV04/EV05/EV07/EV09/EV11/EV15/EV16/EV19/EV23—is mandatory but not exhaustive. Manual outcomes and missing models are also required work.

Apply all nine accepted exception-policy decisions: correct unaccepted defects; calculate defaults and record dice/narrative acknowledgement; require reasoned shared Rules Exceptions separately from Table Adjustments; use one current-rank bonus to next eligible week's bounded event chance without accumulation; resolve no-Twice duplicates independently and apply actual Twice clauses; keep persistent Double Agent's cache restriction and single −2 penalty until ending; allow immediate first buyoff then a militia-wide four-week cooldown at twice current minimum treasury; retain day-based Special Order timing and explicit receipt while Broker Market keeps next-Activity timing; floor whole counts without invented minima and preserve money to copper precision.

Explicit regression examples include rank-1 one-action baseline, failed dismissal still removing its target and adding Notoriety, first-week skip independent of displayed week, post-loss rank progression, ordered costs before Theft, no action gain without its action, complete readiness, exact-once modifiers, duplicate High Morale/Found Fire/Calm before the Storm behavior, and all queued-effect duration/check/loss branches. Product exceptions for shared unlocked slots, stable over-capacity choices, local navigation, fixed persistent eligibility, exact Confirmation and immutable history remain in force.

**Completion boundary**

This ticket produces the migration plan only. Implementation, deployment and production changes are separate work. Detailed History Rewrite and exception/receipt presentation remain outside the map's destination; required data, semantic operations and outcome coverage are included. No new domain terms or ADR are needed. Existing local AGENTS.md and CONTEXT.md edits remain untouched.

Review record: the reviewer checked every behavior/completeness item, COMPLETE.CORPUS, and REVIEW.SIGNOFF, then confirmed “done” in the review conversation on 2026-09-23. Codex performed the five SOURCE classifications at the reviewer’s request. This approval covers the reviewed semantics and recorded corrections; production deployment and cutover are not approved by this record.

## Evidence and review scope

Human review is complete: AndreasUnunger approved the full corpus and all 487 active behavior checks on 2026-09-23. The checked review above includes the recorded corrections. F02.ap-caps was removed by instruction; story-reward extra actions (F04.context) are deferred to [#98](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/98).

Final verification on 2026-09-23:

- **1,003 tests across 106 files pass**, with no skipped or pending results.
- **Typecheck, lint, and all three build-boundary tests pass.**
- **All nine isolated browser results pass** on their first attempts in the final run, including both authenticated players, persistence races, exact Confirmation, and immutable history.
- **486 of 487 cases have passing mapped evidence.** Three explicit operational gaps remain: E06.preserve, P11.cutover, and P11.legacy. Some cases have passing tests but still lack their deployment rehearsal.
- All mapped test identifiers and source fingerprints are current. The strict gate's only error is **“Completeness gate: 3 remaining gaps.”**

Those three gaps are agent implementation/rehearsal work in [#89](https://github.com/AndreasUnunger/EverythingPath/issues/89), not further questions for this human review. They cover carry preservation, paused restartable cutover, and recovery before reopening. Explicit old-version request rejection and forced reload handling are out of scope. Production cutover is separate (#90); no production changes were made.

The deeper Spec review found no remaining concrete defect after correcting existing-militia setup's Upkeep behavior. The Standards review found no documented violations; its naming cleanup is now fixed. The helper and view-model field use event-choice names, and the unused teams parameter is removed. This naming-only follow-up passes typecheck, lint, and all 1,003 tests across 106 files. The browser setup test and Hidden Agenda test identifiers were also corrected, then verified afresh.

The browser and strict acceptance records below describe commit `1d5329b`, before the naming-only follow-up. They have not been rerun for that follow-up; its separate checks are recorded above.
