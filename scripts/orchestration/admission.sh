#
# Memory is the owner's `real` measure: memory.current - file + shmem, the
# cgroup's memory without reclaimable file cache (slice-sampler.sh). Every
# bounded unit and capped.sh scope samples its own cgroup every 5 s
# (admission_sample) and records its real peak in peaks.log, one line per
# job: <time> <class> <real peak> <memory.peak> <result> <seconds> <id> <what>
# (a capped.sh command's what is "<dir>: <command>", or "<dir>:
# CAPPED_KIND=<kind> <command>" when its kind was declared; cut to 100
# characters).
# A class's reservation is the largest real peak of its qualifying runs (ok,
# at least 60 s) plus the table's margin, rounded up to 0.5 GiB, once it has
# 3 of them; before that, the table's seed (memory-reservations.tsv, each
# with its source). Any recorded run above that raises it at once (its peak
# plus the margin), so OOM, killed and short runs only ever raise it. A role
# (a model session) always reserves 0.
#
# A heavy command is admitted when the active reservations plus its own fit
# the budget (18 GiB), or when nothing else is active; otherwise it queues.
# Queued entries go in order: high (bounded.sh jobs: gates, preps, other
# bounded commands) before normal (capped.sh: curator and coder commands),
# then first come first served, and nothing is admitted ahead of an earlier
# entry. A bounded job registers its intent before it waits for its locks
# (pending, no memory), so while a gate or prep waits, for its locks or for
# memory, no curator command is admitted before it. Admission never changes a cap: the units and ep-heavy.slice keep theirs.
#
# A reservation lives as long as a process holds its lock: the reserving
# process takes a flock on entries/<id>.held and its children inherit the
# descriptor, so it is held until the job's last process exits, however it
# ends (exit, kill, OOM). Every admission and status sweeps first: an entry
# whose lock is free belongs to a job that is gone and is removed (an "ended"
# event; that is how every capped.sh command's reservation ends, and how a
# crashed owner's is cleaned up). A bounded unit's ExecStopPost also releases
# it by id, after the unit's last process is gone; the wrapper itself never
# releases an admitted reservation (its descendants may outlive it). Locks come first: a job reserves memory
# only after it holds its heavy-job locks (bounded-lock.sh) and never waits
# for a lock while it holds memory.
#
# A queued wait ends with exit 143 on TERM or INT or on `admission.sh cancel`,
# and with 73 after BOUNDED_WAIT_TIMEOUT seconds when that is set.
# State: $BOUNDED_STATE_DIR (else $EP_ORCH, else ep-orch beside the main
# checkout)/admission/: entries/, peaks.log, events.log (one line per queued
# wait, admission, release, end, drop, cancel, timeout and failed write), seq
# and the mutex. Entries are pending (a gate's or prep's intent while it waits
# for its locks: no memory, but ahead of every curator command), queued or
# active.
# Tests only: ADMISSION_TABLE (another table), ADMISSION_INTERVAL (the queue
# poll, default 1 s), ADMISSION_SAMPLE_INTERVAL (the sampler's, default 5 s).

# last, partial, word first), and a prep-light-<n> line whose unit log
# ($state/logs/bounded-<id>.log) says "prep: full" as prep-full-<n>. A named
# id's capped.sh line (curator or curator-<kind>) is relabelled by its command
# as well, as if it had run without CAPPED_KIND (an id with no capped.sh line
# is refused with 64). --declared <kind> (lint, corpus, test or light;
# anything else is refused with 64) restricts the whole pass: it relabels by
# its command only each capped.sh line declared with that kind (its command
# starts "CAPPED_KIND=<kind>": admission_run_sampled), and the named ids, and
# no other line: no plain curator line, undeclared or otherwise declared line,
# or prep line. Lines recorded before that record change say nothing of a
# declared kind, so a run among them declared with the wrong kind is only
# told apart by naming it. Prints "<id> <old> -> <new>" for
# each line it would change. --write rewrites the log (locked;
# admission_record appends under the same lock, so drain capped.sh scopes
# that started with an older admission.sh first) only when something
# changes. It replaces just the class word of the changed lines (sed on their
# line numbers, in bytes), so every other byte stays as it was: lines that
# aren't records, blank lines, CRs, long lines, and a last line with no
# newline (kept without one). It writes peaks.log.tmp, proves that by undoing
# the changes and comparing the result with the log byte for byte, keeps the
# old log as peaks.log.bak-<stamp>-<random>, then renames. It refuses with 72,
# leaving the log as it was, when the log holds a NUL byte (bash can't read it
# exactly), when a line it would change can't be classified or isn't
