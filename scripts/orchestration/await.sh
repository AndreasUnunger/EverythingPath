# usage: await.sh <id>... [--timeout <seconds>]
# Blocks until any listed run has finished, then prints one line per finished
# run and exits 0. Call it again with the runs still going. On timeout it
# prints "still running: <ids>" and exits 124. Polls every 5 seconds
# (AWAIT_INTERVAL). An id is either:
# - a spawn.sh run id: prints "<id> <exit code> <report path>", or
#   "<id> lost <report path>" when the worker is gone without an exit file;
# - a bounded.sh invocation id (its "id:" line; $EP_ORCH/bounded/<id>/):
#   prints "<id> <exit code> <log path> <outcome>" from the run's receipt,
#   outcome ok, failed, lockRefused, oom, killed or submitFailed. Without a
#   receipt, the unit's systemd state decides (a note goes to stderr;
#   bounded-outcome.sh classifies both), a unit that is gone prints
#   "<id> lost <log path>", and while the user manager doesn't answer it
#   keeps waiting. A label is never an id: invocations that share a label
#   are told apart only by their ids.
