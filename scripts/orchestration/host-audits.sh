# The gate host's half of remote heavy checks in replace mode (gate-modes, "Remote heavy checks";
# owner 2026-11-02): the tests in the candidate's host-audits.json skip in CI for want of the
# sources only this host has, so they run here, exactly those tests, for the commit at
# <worktree>'s HEAD. Like triage-failures.sh's full suite: a fresh detached ep-gate-* checkout
# beside the main checkout (committed files plus `pnpm install --offline`, removed on exit),
# under $EP_ORCH/heavy.lock, with `pnpm test` and the JSON reporter. Like the rest of a replace
# gate it runs without the light lane's read lock, which only triage-failures.sh takes.
# The selection (remote_checks.py selection) is the listed files and one pattern anchored on the
# listed full names, so a listed file's other tests are filtered out. remote_checks.py audit then
# requires every listed test passed, nothing else ran, the list is the one the manifest binds and
# Vitest exited 0. <evidence-dir> (existing, absolute) gets host-audits-list.json (the
# candidate's list), host-audits-report.json and host-audits.json, the verdict. Exits 0 only
# when that verdict passed.
