# shellcheck shell=bash
# Sourced by cur-prep.sh and land-queue.sh after paths.sh. The curation prep's
# test plan, its shared-store count and its receipt (#759).
#
# prep_plan <base> [full]: in a batch worktree, the checks for HEAD against
# <base> (the feature head it was rebased onto), one per line:
#   mode light|full
#   reason <why prep runs the whole of tests/catalog>   (full only)
#   test <path>                                          (sorted, unique)
#   note <text>
# Light prep runs the batch tests the whole <base>..HEAD diff touches (every
# changed test file, and every test of each batch whose artifacts change,
# older batches included, integration tests too), the tests the diff reaches
# through imports (`pnpm -s test:affected`, scripts/affected-tests.ts), plus
# the fixed guards. A test:affected failure, or its exit 3 (a changed path it
# cannot trace), makes the plan full.
# Anything else in the diff (shared tooling, schema, validators, including the
# guards and any test file that exports helpers, other fixtures, an edited or
# removed shared-store file, a removed test) makes it full, as does a missing
# guard: when in doubt, full.
#
# Receipts: cur-prep.sh writes $orch/logs/cur-<n>-prep.receipt (key=value)
# when prep passes, and removes it when a prep starts. The key is taken before
# the checks run, and no receipt is written if HEAD, its tree, the base or the
# worktree's state changed meanwhile. land-queue.sh reuses it only when the
# commit, base, lockfile, prep scripts, check configuration, toolchain and the
# test environment (prep_env) are all unchanged (prep_reusable).
# tests=local says prep ran its plan here; tests=remote (cur-prep.sh
# --remote-suite) says it ran every other check, recorded the plan and left
# the tests to the remote full suite on the exact tree. A remote receipt
# stands in only for a landing under remote checks (prep_reusable ... remote).
# The tests mode is bound twice, whatever the plan: checks hashes it with the
# check list (always compared, unlike config, which a full plan skips), and a
# local receipt must name its Vitest log beside it, unchanged since the prep
# (testLog, testLogSha256), while a remote one names none.
