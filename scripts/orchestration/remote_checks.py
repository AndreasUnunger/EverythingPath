"""Remote heavy-check evidence (remote-heavy-checks-v1) for one exact landing candidate.

Boat publishes ORCH/remote-checks/<runId>/manifest.json. A gate whose gate.json names it in
remoteChecks {path, sha256, mode} accepts it only for the exact tree, base, lockfile,
toolchain, environment and canonical commands, with a complete all-green suite. Any defect
refuses with a named reason; nothing falls back to a local or partial pass. The sha256 pin
detects corruption, moved directories and stale scope; it is not cryptographic attestation.

The remote commit is gate-push.sh's tree-only commit (owner 2026-11-02): parentless, with the
candidate's tree, its message trailers naming the reviewed commit, the base and the tree. The
manifest binds its tree to TREE, Gate-Reviewed to REVIEWED (or the prepared squash) and Gate-Base
to BASE; ancestry is checked here, on the gate host, since the integration history is never pushed.

Sharded runs (owner 2026-11-06, speed-ci-shards): CI runs the suite as N parallel `--shard=i/N` jobs on
GitHub's free runners, typecheck and lint in a `static` job, and an assemble job that merges the shards'
blob reports (`vitest --merge-reports`) into the one `full.json`. Every manifest carries `static` (that
job's facts) and `shards` (one row per shard: exactly indexes 1..N, canonical argv, exit 0, its log, JSON
report and blob hashed, its job's facts equal to the manifest's), and its suite row is the canonical
merge; the single-job shape is refused (fix r1: root ruling, no legacy downgrade). The merged report is
bound to its shards by construction (fix r1): each shard report stands alone under the remote suite's
verdict (non-empty, all green but for listed host-audit skips, no snapshot write, counters reconciled),
and the merged report must be exactly their composition: the same test files, each in one shard only,
each with its shard's status and assertions, and every counter the shards' sum. A merged report carries
no snapshot summary (Vitest fills it only while tests run), which is why the shards' reports carry it.
Attempts (fix r1 on split B): every part's runner names the manifest's own GitHub run id and attempt, and
the manifest's `producers` (the assemble job's needs results for remote-shard and remote-static) must both
be success, so a failed or partial rerun can never pass on an earlier attempt's parts.

The one exception to all-green (owner 2026-11-02): a test in the candidate's pinned host-audit
list (AUDITS; it needs sources only the gate host has) may skip remotely. The manifest binds
the list's sha256; the gate host then runs exactly those tests (host-audits.sh, `audit`) or,
in compare mode, takes them from its local full suite.
